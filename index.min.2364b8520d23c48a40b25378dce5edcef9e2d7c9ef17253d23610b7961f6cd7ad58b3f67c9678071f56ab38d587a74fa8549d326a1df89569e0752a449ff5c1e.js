Once she has discussed the more ‘sociological’ reasons for American academics holding this view (of which the most powerful/cynical is that it is essentially a convenient denial of responsibility by Americans for their effect on the international system), Strange goes on to elaborate the four structures of power in IPE. This exposition closely parallels (though in a brief form) the arguments that appear in States and Markets (1988). Strange again identifies the American domestic political process (and constitutional structure) as being the root of many of international problems. Strange suggests that the domestic and international cannot be separated analytically, and her structural analysis of power explains the effects of American domestic politics on the international political economy.

This in the main is because they are already tacitly included, but there is little engagement with the economist’s prioritising of efficiency or the International Relations scholar’s of peace. Part of the job of IPE must be to make clear what choices these priorities represent and to discuss alternatives and different value hierarchies.\nKeywords: Politcal Economy;Theory\nText access (external link)] https://www.routledge.com/International-Political-Economy-Yearbook-Volume-1-An-International-Political/Hollist/p/book/9780367165239\n"}),a.add({id:154,href:"/archive/protectionism_and_world_politics/",title:"Protectionsim and World Politics",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"In Protectionism and World Politics International Organization39, no.2(Spring).233-259.1985.\nIn discussing the question of protectionism Strange contends that her structural understanding of the international political economy - with four structures; security, production, finance, knowledge - shows that concerns about trade ‘inefficiencies’ as a disruptive element within the international system miss the real problem. She argues that trade is only a ‘secondary structure’ which is influenced and shaped by the primary structures. The disruption in the international system and trade relations is in fact a symptom of disruptions within the primary structures, and especially the financial structure.

She then examines UN economic multilateralism utilising an eclectic combination of all three perspectives and concludes that as each approach continues to look to international organisation to sustain the values it emphasises, despite its failings economic multilateralism is likely to continue to be regarded as a worthwhile enterprise.

However, though the alternatives are presented as a hegemonic system run by the US or a multilateral system managed through the GATT, Strange argues that the reality is a cob-web of bi-lateral agreements which accords with many people’s desire to have their own state manage their affairs.\nKeywords: International Institutions, Trade\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:157,href:"/archive/the-global-political-economy-1959-1984/",title:"The Global Political Economy, 1959-1984",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Global Political Economy, 1959-1984,\u0026rdquo; International Journal 39, no. 2 (1984): 267-283.\nAfter discussing some terms she would like to see the back of (‘actors’, ‘issue-areas’), reviewing years of the Global Political Economy, Strange proposes four structures that condition change.

In addition she suggests five structures of power in IPE, noting that she is adding to the Marxist concept of a production structure. The others are the financial, security and knowledge structures she would continue to use as well as an element she termed the ‘welfare structure’. This fifth structure was to account for politically determined arrangements which allocate the risks to human life and contentment.

She suggests that the world economic crisis has three interrelated aspects: unemployment, ‘flagging trade’, and unstable money. As in ‘The Management of Surplus Capacity: Or how does theory stand up to protectionism 1970s style?’ (1979) she shows some scepticism to the arguments that demonise protectionism, and suggests this is an essentially ideological position that would not repay global implementation. After briefly rehearsing the global financial history of the previous decade, Strange suggests that financial regulation which in the last analysis is dependent on certain sovereign states, can never be disinterested. As she would argue in more extended analyses later, she sees the role of the American financial system as destabilising because of the priority it gives to the interests of the domestic political system. Indeed until the United States is willing to ‘lead’ the global system, instead of working in its own interest, those interests will be compromised. Strange, as she would do often in future works, suggests a pragmatic acceptance of American reach over the global system, and suggests a sort of civilising mission to educate them into responsible leadership.\nKeywords: Europe, Hegemony, Money and Finance, United States\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:161,href:"/archive/cave_hic_dragones_a_critique_of_regime_analysis/",title:"Cave!

As such it has at least a totemic importance. Strange argues for five shortcoming of regime theory: that it is a passing fad, is imprecise, has a value bias, is too static and is too state-centred. As in ‘What is Economic Power, and Who has it?’ (1975) the underlying history of bargains, which condition regimes are emphasised as being crucial to any understanding of the IPE.

She briefly discusses the steel and aerospace sectors, to argue for the need to engage in a structuralist analysis of political economy. She also suggests that the ‘bargains’ that IPE should be concerned with include those between firms and governments and those between labour and firms.

Any analysis should start by recognising the key historical bargains that were made within the economic structure. But the editors are not sure of the present possibility of an all embracing theory of international political economy. They conclude: there is a lessening possibility of dividing off the national from the international; any study of international relations (political or economic) must take account of values to avoid sterility in the analysis of outcomes; a structural analysis is not necessarily incompatible with realism; and IPE can only be meaningful where it builds on international economic history.

She wants work on the international monetary system to go beyond a mere mechanical explanation and to move towards a more political analysis (which would also include an assessment of the impact of technology on global finance).

After discussing recent developments in the political economy of German and Europe, Strange suggests that it is time for Germany to consider a role more like that adopted briefly by De Gaulle’s France in the early 1960s, that of ‘leader of the opposition’.

Suggesting that states can choose to grow by direction (the socialist route) or via debt, she argues that recently the combination of the welfare state and more complex credit system has allowed many states to reduce the debt risk they explicitly face and therefore expand through the extensive use of credit.

Furthermore, provided it is well managed there is nothing to indicate that a larger pool of credit (and therefore indebtedness) is any more problematic than a smaller pool, explicitly modifying her conclusion regarding the links between risky loans and political conflict in \u0026lsquo;Debts, Defaulters and Development\u0026rsquo;\nKeywords: Money and Finance\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:171,href:"/archive/the_management_of_surplus_productive_capacity/",title:"The Mamagement of Surplus Capacity: Or How Does Theory Stand up to Protectionism 1970s style?",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Mamagement of Surplus Capacity: Or How Does Theory Stand up to Protectionism 1970s style?\u0026rdquo; International Organisation 36, no. 2 (1979): 303-335.\nIn this article, which is a clear precursor to (Strange and Tooze 1981), Strange discusses the management of surplus capacity in three sectors of the international economy - steel, textiles and shipbuilding, and the recourse to protectionism. She then goes on to discuss the problems this implies for mainstream theories of international economics. She argues that Liberalism, theories of development, and organisational or functionalist theories do not offer satisfactory explanations for the resurgence of tariff barriers. This is partly because none of these theories deal with economic power satisfactorily, though Strange offers little in the way of a corrective. She concludes by again arguing that it is increasingly difficult to draw a line between international and domestic policy, and thus theories that only deal with one or other side of this duality will by implication fail in their analysis.

Having suggested that the central country in the monetary system (the U.S.) could either try to co-ordinate activities, or by its very dominance alleviate the crisis by putting its own house in order, she suggests the best (though least likely) solution would be some form of global central bank.

On one side the authors suggest that developing countries, where possible may need to develop national carriers to allow them to influence the management of shipping as well offering an secure avenue for their own trade. However, the authors also stress that a political response to the problems is required from the developed states before the problem leads to major disruption in international trade.

Strange forcefully argues that: political economy is crucial to understanding international relations; the US is dominant due to its financial power, not its military or economic might; internationalisation (or now ‘globalisation’) diminishes the prospective advantages of regional economic solutions; the ‘market’ must be understood as an actor! Bearing these ideas in mind she then examines the ‘Dollar Crisis’ concluding that international institutions were revealed as powerless when the US wished to follow a specific policy (revealing its power).

Only by building up from systematic sectoral analyses can the asymmetrical bargaining processes, the impact of technology, the influence of markets and the politicisation of the international political economy be understood. She then offers in the second article one such sectoral analysis (of world shipping), which carries some material forward from \u0026lsquo;International shipping and the developing countries\u0026rsquo; (with Richard Holland, 1976).\nKeywords: Theory, Trade, International Institutions\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:179,href:"/archive/the_financial_factor_and_the_balance_of_power/",title:"The Financial Factor and the Balance of Power",description:"Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Financial Factor and the Balance of Power.\u0026rdquo; In Foreign Policy: Policy Making and Implementation, edited by James Barber, Josephine Negro, and Micheal Smith, 35-46.

In this manifestation, there are three dimensions of power in the international political economy - security, ‘ideology’ and economic. There is more concern, though, with a location of four level or stages at which economic power is apparent - the world market structure; international co-operative relations; national/governmental control of markets; and the operational level of the economic transactions themselves. The importance of the history of bargains for the international structure is identified, but not developed fully.

Where it has been able to influence the international economy this has been through symbolic actions rather than by direct intervention. Here, Strange stresses the political embededness of international markets, and relates the inability of the UN to intervene to the lack of any overarching international political authority, either represented by the UN or other international organisations.\nKeywords: Politcal Economy, United Nations, International Economics\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:191,href:"/archive/international_economics/",title:"International Economics and International Relations: a Case of Mutual Neglect",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;International Economics and International Relations: a Case of Mutual Neglect.\u0026rdquo; International Affairs 46, no. 2 (1970): 304-315.\nStrange’s first call for the development of International Political Economy as a separate discipline. She identifies a major void between the academic study of international relations and the study of international economics. The failure to fill this void will result in a loss of relevance for the subjects and an inability to deal with the major problems that beset the international economy. This will also lead to the inability to analyse the two main tendencies in the international economic system; growing international co-operation and organisation, and increased domestic defensiveness over national welfare issues. Only by introducing economics into International Relations courses, and politics into International Economics courses could these shortcomings be addressed.\u0026quot; excerpt3: \u0026ldquo;Keywords: Political-Economy, Theory, Foundational-Work\nKeywords: Political Economy, Theory, Foundational Work, International Relations, International Economics\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:192,href:"/archive/international_money_matters/",title:"International Money Matters",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;International Money Matters.\u0026rdquo; International Affairs 46, no. 4 (1970): 737-743.\nStrange uses a survey of a number of recent textbooks (and other writing) on international economics to criticise the economics profession as a whole for taking too little account of politics. Most economists are satisfied with international growth and rising ‘efficiency’ she argues without ever asking questions regarding the evident inequalities in the intentional economy or the political dimensions of the uneven growth between countries.

Conflict can be caused by one monetary system damaging another. The expansion of the international economy requires more and more sophisticated and complex monetary and financial arrangements and the forms of association among them.

She notes that military expenditure is seldom included in the requests for debtor country adjustments. Despite the international economic organisations’ role, states were still able to manipulate their creditors through political pressures. Interestingly, Strange notes with great prescience that while at the time states could still play this role, with the continuing internationalisation of money markets (and the emergent technologies that made such developments possible), this would in the future present a strategic problem for states’ governments. The approach she favoured was for the reduction of indebtedness to be borne not by the deficit countries but rather by the surplus countries. That is, the solution to the debt crisis was not more adjustment in the ‘Third World’, but was some form of debt forgiveness.\nKeywords: International Institutions, Money and Finance\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:195,href:"/archive/research_on_international_organisation/",title:"Research on International Organisation",description:"By Susan Strange and Geoffry Goodwin",content:"Goodwin, Geoffry, and Susan Strange. \u0026ldquo;Research on International Organisation.\u0026rdquo; Social Science Research Council Review of Current Research 2.

Developing states dependence on ‘supplier credit’, and frequent rescheduling of other debts will lead to eventual wide-spread default unless action is taken. She suggests that: principles governing international loans should be established; these ‘rules’ should be applied through aid-agencies and other international bodies; technical assistance to finance ministries should be available from multilateral institutions (the World Bank, possibly) to ensure states understand their fiscal position and their options. Strange argues that these measures are necessary to forestall a return to the nineteenth century policies of forced intervention, or economic ostracisation of developing states.

She argues that while the City has benefited from the expansion of the ‘Euro-currency’ markets, in its ‘middleman’ role, this has led to a number of problems for sterling both in the wider context of the international economy and, more specifically, the context of the emerging European Community. Sterling had become more vulnerable to changes elsewhere. She is sceptical about the possibility of Britain enjoying any financial benefit from joining the ‘six’, noting that the CAP payments and the IMF repayments together would form an unendurable strain on the exchequer.\nKeywords: Europe, Money and Finance, United Kingdom, European Integration\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:198,href:"/archive/the_sterling_question/",title:"The Sterling Question",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Sterling Question.\u0026rdquo; In Britain and the Common Market edited by Anthony Moncrieff, 43-50.

Discussing the links between Britain and the European Community, she examines the international position of sterling in a time of monetary crisis. Noting both the lack of reserves held by the British government and Britain’s extra-European financial commitments, Strange argues that de Gaulle may be correct in thinking it is impossible for Britain to act ‘like good Europeans’. Thus, one proposed solution to the sterling problem, monetary association with Europe, would have little support on the Continent. Strange finally focuses on the British government’s economic philosophy and its lack of political will as the key problems; issues she would return to frequently, not least of all in her later criticisms of American foreign economic policy.\nKeywords: Europe, Money and Finance, European Integration\nText Access {External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:199,href:"/archive/a_new_look_at_trade_and_aid/",title:"A New Look at Trade and Aid",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Susan Strange, \u0026ldquo;A New Look at Trade and Aid,\u0026rdquo; International Affairs 42 no. 1 (January, 1966): 61 - 73.\nIn the light of UNCTAD’s problems, declining optimism over foreign aid and the unfavourable terms of trade for developing states, Strange suggests that ‘Prebisch’s thesis’, allowing subsidised exporting by developing states, and the dropping of tariff barriers, while unpopular would be a useful way forward. She suggests an ‘import bounty’ system, to diffuse opposition, paid for through a tax on developed states domestic and exporting manufacturers. While encouraging industry in developing states, instead of commodity exports, this would reduce the ‘loading of the dice’ identified by G77. Even if not achievable multilaterally, bilateral implementation would help revive help to the developing world and help developed state’s industry to revive through competition. Strange posits the structural problems of international trade, while suggesting the way forward through a combination of economics and politics.\nReprinted in: Roger Tooze and Christopher May, eds.

Taking a rather optimistic (though at that time widespread view) of the Soviet Bloc’s economic situation vis-à-vis the West, Strange concludes that Soviet economic (and political) influence is reliant on economic ‘trouble-spots’ and the aversion by many developing states to the West’s recent history of colonialism. This leads her to suggest that money then spent on military aid might be better spent helping developing countries deal with agricultural surplus capacity in the global a market, a theme she would return to in \u0026lsquo;The Management of Surplus Capacity\u0026rsquo; (1979). Furthermore, the economic cycle in the developed states could be better managed to reduce the destabilising effects on primary producers. Thus political activism by the West could do much to counter the ‘war without weapons’ represented by the contemporary Soviet trade and aid policy.\nKeywords: Porduction, Security, Trade, International Relations\nText Access (external Link)\n"}),a.add({id:202,href:"/archive/point_four/",title:"Point Four.

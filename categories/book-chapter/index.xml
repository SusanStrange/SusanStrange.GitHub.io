      <title>International Political Economy: The Story so Far and the Way Ahead</title>

      <description>In An International Political Economy (International Political Economy Yearbook No.1), edited by W. Ladd Hollist and F. LaMond Tullis, 13-25.Boulder:Westview Press, 1985.
After noting again the essential role of economic historians in the study and understanding of the international political economy, Strange builds on an appreciation of the value of development economists, a plea for the re-inclusion of values into the study of IPE. This in the main is because they are already tacitly included, but there is little engagement with the economist’s prioritising of efficiency or the International Relations scholar’s of peace.</description>

      <description>In Diplomacy at the United Nations, edited by Geoff Berridge and Anthony Jennings, 109-129. London: Macmillan Press, 1985.
After reviewing the four values authority might pursue - wealth, security, justice and freedom (an argument developed at more length in States and Markets (1988), she uses these value choices to interrogate the three main paradigms used to think about the international political economy, liberalism, structuralism and nationalism. She then examines UN economic multilateralism utilising an eclectic combination of all three perspectives and concludes that as each approach continues to look to international organisation to sustain the values it emphasises, despite its failings economic multilateralism is likely to continue to be regarded as a worthwhile enterprise.</description>

      <title>Structures, Values and Risk in the Study of the International Political Economy</title>

In this article Strange argues for the centrality of questions surrounding the nature of risk and how it is mitigated, managed and transferred in the international economy. In addition she suggests five structures of power in IPE, noting that she is adding to the Marxist concept of a production structure.</description>

This short article discusses the international financial sector and the interaction between American monetary policy and European exchange rates, monetary policy and the then new European Monetary System. While containing little explication of structural power, being more of an historical overview, the article is of interest for Strange’s concluding discussion of the reasons for American domination of the international financial structure.</description>

      <title>The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis,&amp;rdquo; In Economic Issues and the Atlantic Community, edited by Wolfram F. Hanrieder, 15-26. New York: Praeger, 1982.
Strange here proposes a structural approach that is implied by her argument that an analysis of the global political economy must be concerned with its ‘environment’. However, while suggesting three of her four later structures - here, security, monetary and production structures - she also includes a number of other structures - transport, trade, communication - that would later become in her schema, secondary structures.</description>

      <title>Germany and the World Monetary System</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Germany and the World Monetary System,&amp;rdquo; In West Germany: A European and Global Power, edited by Wilfrid L. Kohl and Georgio Basevi, 45-62. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1980.
Strange suggests that for any major state in the global system, such as Germany there are five roles that could be adopted by its government: ‘leader of the system’, ‘obedient ally’, ‘bigemonist partner’, ‘lone ranger’ or ‘leader of the opposition’. After discussing recent developments in the political economy of German and Europe, Strange suggests that it is time for Germany to consider a role more like that adopted briefly by De Gaulle’s France in the early 1960s, that of ‘leader of the opposition’.</description>

      <title>Debt and Default in the International Political Economy</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/debt_and_default_in_the_ipe/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/debt_and_default_in_the_ipe/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Debt and Default in the International Political Economy,&amp;rdquo; In Debt and the Less Developed Countries, edited by Johnathan David, 7-26. Boulder, Westview Press, 1979.
Explicitly linking back to &amp;lsquo;Debts, Defaulters and Development&amp;rsquo; (1967) Strange examines the contemporary political economy of international debt, but also seeks to put this situation into a longer historical context than merely the previous ten years. Suggesting that states can choose to grow by direction (the socialist route) or via debt, she argues that recently the combination of the welfare state and more complex credit system has allowed many states to reduce the debt risk they explicitly face and therefore expand through the extensive use of credit.</description>

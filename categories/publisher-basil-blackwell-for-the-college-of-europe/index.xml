      <description>Book Chapter: Strange identifies two main obstructions to a constructive dialogue between the United States and Europe over international trade: America’s lack of interest in maintaining a steady provision of credit to the interdependent international system; and Europe’s inability to take responsibility for its own defence and security, and therefore reducing its dependence on America. This leads Strange to conclude that the U.S. has abused rather than lost its power in the international economy, refusing to allow the separation the international risks from domestic bank activities in developing countries, taking no notice of the Brandt’s commissions call for a independent multilateral financial institution, and not taking the role of international lender of last resort.</description>

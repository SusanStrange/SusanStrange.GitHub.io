      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;International Shipping and the Developing Countries.&amp;rdquo; World Development 4, no. 4 (1976): 241-251.
Focusing on the importance of sea transport for developing countries that need to gain access to other markets (both for imports and their own exports) Strange and Holland examine the political economy of liner conferences by which international shipping capacity is managed. This private management system does not serve the developing states well leading UNCTAD to press for fairer international rules of conduct for international shipping.</description>

      <title>The Study of Transnational Relations</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Study of Transnational Relations.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 52, no. 3 (1976): 333-345.
Using the ‘Dollar Crisis’ as a way of examining the problems which beset academic approaches to international relations Strange suggests that: foreign policy analysis seems unable to recognise the centrality of economic problems for states; (Neo)functionalism is far too optimistic concerning the possibility of international integration; much ‘abstract theorising’, such as game theory, seems to have no connection with what is happening in the international system; and international economics has diverted attention away from international political problems.</description>

      <title>Who Runs World Shipping?</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan.&amp;ldquo;Who Runs World Shipping?&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 52, no. 3 (1976): 346-367.
In the first article Strange sets out an outline method for sectoral analysis in the international economy. This is prefaced by a critical engagement with the Nye and Keohane ‘transnational politics’ approach. After stressing the inseparability of politics and economics, and the crucial authority/market trade-off, she suggests three analytical questions that must be asked in any sectoral analysis; questions about the loci and distribution of power over economic processes, the who, why, and how of economic intervention, and the question of the consequences, and benefits.</description>

      <title>What is Economic Power, and Who Has it?</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/what_is_economic_power/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;What is Economic Power, and Who Has it?&amp;rdquo; International Journal 30, no. 2 (1975): 207-224.
Here Strange commits to print an early version of the structure of power theory which she would develop over the next thirteen years. In this manifestation, there are three dimensions of power in the international political economy - security, ‘ideology’ and economic. There is more concern, though, with a location of four level or stages at which economic power is apparent - the world market structure; international co-operative relations; national/governmental control of markets; and the operational level of the economic transactions themselves.</description>

      <title>Review of : R.J Barber The American Corporation: Its Power, Its Money, Its Politics</title>

Strange feels that the author overstates the political power and influence of multinational in themselves. She identifies a close connection between the US government and larger corporations. Interestingly this is a position that she gradually moves away from in subsequent work, identifying transnational firms as actors in their own right by 67), arguing for their major importance as actors in the international political economy.</description>

      <title>Sterling and British Policy: A Political View</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/sterling_and_british_policy_a_political_view/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/sterling_and_british_policy_a_political_view/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Sterling and British Policy: A Political View.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 47, no. 2 (1971): 302-315.
Strange sets the decline of sterling and the rise of the dollar in the context of international politics. She stresses the need to integrate economic studies with those of international relations. Both state behaviour and the behaviour of international society, hitherto interpreted in terms of power and politics should now be extended to take in the monetary factor especially in the light of economic interdependence - the monetary factor is bound to become increasingly important in understanding state behaviour.</description>

      <title>International Economics and International Relations: a Case of Mutual Neglect</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/international_economics/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;International Economics and International Relations: a Case of Mutual Neglect.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 46, no. 2 (1970): 304-315.
Strange’s first call for the development of International Political Economy as a separate discipline. She identifies a major void between the academic study of international relations and the study of international economics. The failure to fill this void will result in a loss of relevance for the subjects and an inability to deal with the major problems that beset the international economy.</description>

      <title>International Money Matters</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;International Money Matters.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 46, no. 4 (1970): 737-743.
Strange uses a survey of a number of recent textbooks (and other writing) on international economics to criticise the economics profession as a whole for taking too little account of politics. Most economists are satisfied with international growth and rising ‘efficiency’ she argues without ever asking questions regarding the evident inequalities in the intentional economy or the political dimensions of the uneven growth between countries.</description>

      <title>The Politics of International Currencies</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_politics_of_international_currencies/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_politics_of_international_currencies/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Politics of International Currencies.&amp;rdquo; World Politics 23, no. 2 (1970): 215-231.
Here Strange argues that because of interdependence states are not so much defenders of national territories or peoples but of national currencies and monetary systems. Conflict can be caused by one monetary system damaging another. The expansion of the international economy requires more and more sophisticated and complex monetary and financial arrangements and the forms of association among them.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Changing Trends in World Trade.&amp;rdquo; In Year Book of World Affairs 1962, George W. Keeton, Georg Schwarzenberger, editors. 139-158. London: Stevens, 1962.
Here Strange notes that since 1945 although manufacturing growth has accelerated expanding the trade between developed states there has been less growth in the demand for raw materials and agricultural goods. This distorted or uneven growth in trade had not only had an unsettling effect of world trade, but has also required developing states to take out loans to support their development.</description>

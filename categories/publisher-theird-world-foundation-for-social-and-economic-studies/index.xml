      <description>Book Chapter: Strange starts this chapter with the suggestion that like Mark Twain reports of the demise of American hegemony are premature. She then presents a short history of U.S. economic policy towards the Third World and the global system as a whole. This allows her to emphasise the structural power approach that she would develop at some length in (1988e) and argue that while many on the left see Americaâ€™s influence as entirely malign, she sees good and bad in its domination of the international system.</description>

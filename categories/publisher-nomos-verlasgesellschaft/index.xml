      <description>Book Chapter: Strange suggests that the two primary activities of any political organisation are the furtherance of security and the control of money, and it is these issues that remain at the centre of the problem of US-Europe relations. Here Strange again challenges the assumption of a loss of American hegemony (and therefore power) in the global system. This leads her to emphasise the need for both political will by the system’s strongest state as well as international and multilateral efforts to attend to the problems of the global system, for it is different perception on either side of the Atlantic of America’s potential to act which are causing continued friction.</description>

      <description>Book Chapter: A brief article in which Strange argues that in the national competition for market shares within the global economy, there are two important strategies, neither of which at that time could the European Community realistically follow. Firstly, state procurement can be used as a stimulus to research and development and secondly the control of market access can be used as a bargaining lever. Unless the single market is used in this way, and a common defence policy is adopted, along with centralised procurement, then Strange envisages Europe (even with closer union) still loosing out to the Americans and Japanese.</description>

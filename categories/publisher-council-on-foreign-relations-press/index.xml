      <description>Book Chapter: Strange develops an argument that the competition for territory in international relations has been superseded by the competition for world market shares. This decline in the importance in territory has engendered among other things an international business civilisation that is based on firms and enterprises rather than nationality. However this seems to be different from the transnational empire she suggests in (1989b). This central change in the international political economy, has led to a diffusion of state power, but still leaves the US the most powerful actor in the world.</description>

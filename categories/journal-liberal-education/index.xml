      <description>Strange uses the work she was co-ordinating with John Stopford, later published as (Strange and Stopford 1991) to launch a critique of the separation of International Relations, International Economics and the research carried out in business schools. She argues that her approach, foregrounding structural power, requires analysis from all three directions and therefore there needs to be much better contact and co-operation between the three fields. Here Strange is again expressing her frustration, which first surfaced in (1970a) and continued to produce recommendations for the breaking down of disciplinary boundaries throughout her subsequent career.</description>

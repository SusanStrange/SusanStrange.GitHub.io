      <description>Book Chapter: Strange’s second major attack on the discipline of international economics as it then stood, see also (1970a). She derides the academic ‘apartheid’ that separates off political considerations from the economic and argues that what is required is a single international studies discipline that encompasses both the politics and economics of international relations (what would eventually become International Political Economy). The only part of international studies that has moved in this direction is ‘development economics’.</description>

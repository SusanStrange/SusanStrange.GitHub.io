      <description>Haggart, Blayne, Natasha Tusikov. *The New Knowledge: Information, Data, and the Remaking of Global Power.&amp;quot; Lantham, MD: Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, 2023. Open Access.
From the global geopolitical arena to the smart city, control over knowledge—particularly over data and intellectual property—has become a key battleground for the exercise of economic and political power. For companies and governments alike, control over knowledge—what scholar Susan Strange calls the knowledge structure—has become a goal unto itself.</description>

      <description>Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov. &amp;ldquo;Introduction.&amp;rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century, edited by Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov, editors. 1-20. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
While the control of knowledge is becoming the dominant means by which economic, political, and social control is exerted globally, the mechanisms through which this is happening—including intellectual property rights, state and commercial surveillance, digitisation and datafication, and a nearly ubiquitous internet mediating human interactions—are often examined separately instead of as part of a larger phenomenon of knowledge governance.</description>

Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT)—internet-connected software embedded within physical products—has the potential to shift fundamentally traditional conceptions of ownership and the ways people can access, use, and control information.</description>

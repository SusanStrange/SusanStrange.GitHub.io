      <description>Goodwin, Geoffry, and Susan Strange. &amp;ldquo;Research on International Organisation.&amp;rdquo; Social Science Research Council Review of Current Research 2. (1968).
Acting as a rapporteur for the SSRC Advisory Group on International Organisation (chaired by Goodwin), Strange maps out current and future research as well as examining its organisation and administration. Though published two year prior to Strangeâ€™s first call for the establishment of International Political Economy, in &amp;lsquo;International economics and international relations: a case of mutual neglect&amp;rsquo; (1970), this report on the discussion of research into international organisation and international relations reveals many themes (from the impact of structure and technology to the importance of international economics) she would develop in her own work.</description>

      <description>Book Chapter: This brief autobiographical essay makes interesting reading and, if one so chooses, may give clues to the personal foundations for Strange’s approach. The essay is weighted towards her earlier life but is none the less informative for that.

      <description>Book Chapter: In this article Strange offers only her second explicit excursion into the epistemology of international theories, the first being a similar section in (1988e). She argues that theories must be more than description, taxonomy, importation of models from other disciplines or quantitative and that theories must explain some aspect of the international system not obvious to ‘commonsense’. In addition she argues for her own version of non-positivism stressing only that rationality of explanation is required for a theory to be scientific.</description>

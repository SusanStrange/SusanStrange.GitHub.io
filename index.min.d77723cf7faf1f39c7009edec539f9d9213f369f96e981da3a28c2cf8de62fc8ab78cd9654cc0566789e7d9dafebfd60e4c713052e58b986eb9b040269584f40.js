coming, Your Majesty\u0026rsquo;: The Case for the LSE’s Great Global Political Economist.\u0026rdquo; Real-World Economic Review 98 (2021).\nThis paper makes three arguments. First, that Susan Strange (1923-1998), who founded the field of international political economy in the UK, is one of the principal thinkers who foresaw multiple aspects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. She deserves credit for her prescience but has been overlooked. Second, that Strange\u0026rsquo;s insight was not a series of lucky guesses but emerged from a rich and consistent theoretical and philosophical understanding of the political economy of the planet.2 Third, that Strange should interest economists today and be thought of as a \u0026lsquo;worldly philosopher\u0026rsquo; – after Heilbroner\u0026rsquo;s term for the first political economists – rather than a figure in a sub-discipline of international relations. With the centenary of her birth in 2023, the time is ripe to reassess this great global political economist of the London School of Economics. It is time to put Strange back into the story we tell about financial globalisation and its discontents. Keywords: Money and Finance\n"}),a.add({id:47,href:"/archive/a_border_seeping_in_all_directions_technologies_of_separation_along_the_us-mexico_border_in_ambos_nogales/",title:"A Border Seeping in All Directions: Technologies of Separation Along the U.S.-Mexico Border in Ambos Nogales",description:"By Allison Fish",content:"Fish, Allison. \u0026ldquo;A Border Seeping in All Directions: Technologies of Separation Along the U.S.-Mexico Border in Ambos Nogales.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century. Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov, editors. 247-272. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.\nThis chapter examines how legal and regulatory concerns have informed the design, selection, and deployment of technological assemblages used to monitor commercial movements along the U.S.-Mexico border in and around Ambos Nogales (Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, and Nogales, Arizona, United States). In the past few decades there has been an increasing concern regarding the balancing of market interests with national security at border ports-of-entry, leading to an intensified monitoring of these narrow commercial chokepoints. At the same time, the surveillance of commercial trade moving through these constrained channels has rapidly transitioned from face-to-face and paper-based mediums to complex systems composed of numerous digital and visualisation technologies. This chapter documents this transition in Ambos Nogales and, in doing so, examines how new technologies have historically been used to identify “trusted” logistics providers and monitor and “control” the flow of goods involved in legitimate commercial trade.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Security\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:48,href:"/archive/a_strange_approach_to_information_network_sharing_and_platform_societies/",title:"A Strange Approach to Information, Network, Sharing, and Platform Societies",description:"By Sara Bannerman, Angela Orasch",content:"Bannerman Sara, Angela Orasch. \u0026ldquo;A Strange Approach to Information, Network, Sharing, and Platform Societies.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century. Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov, editors. 53-80. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.\nSusan Strange’s framework for international political economic analysis emphasises the importance of the interrelationships between what she saw as four interlinked structures and sources of power in the global economy: security, production, finance, and knowledge. As change occurs in one structure, it is important to systematically consider the implications of such changes in the other four structures. This chapter provides an overview of how the knowledge structure interacts with the other three structures of power. Second, it assesses the extent to which four major works related to transformations in the knowledge structure—Daniel Bell’s The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society (1976), Manuel Castells’ trilogy The Network Society (first published 1996–1998), Yochai Benkler’s The Wealth of Networks (2006), and Nick Srnicek’s Platform Capitalism (2017)—examine the interrelationships between Strange’s four structures, and the consequences for their overall conclusions.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Security; Finance; Production\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:49,href:"/archive/conclusion_looking_back_looking_forward/",title:"Conclusion: Looking Back, Looking Forward",description:"By Natasha Tusikov, Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne",content:"Tusikov, Natasha, Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne. \u0026ldquo;Conclusion: Looking Back, Looking Forward.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century.

Each of the chapters critically reflects on the control over knowledge as an important form of power, interactions between state and non-state actors, and knowledge regulation in its many forms. Knowledge regulation entails considering how and why knowledge is legitimised and by whom, the interests served, and the specific power structures underlying these arrangements. To understand the dynamics of a world dominated by the knowledge structure, we need to focus on the rules and norms that shape the legitimation, creation, use, and dissemination of knowledge, as well as those who are shaping these rules, which includes the state and non-state actors, and the interests being served.\nKeywords: Knowledge;\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:50,href:"/archive/disinformation_and_resistance_in_the_surveillance_of_indigenous_protesters/",title:"Disinformation and Resistance in the Surveillance of Indigenous Protesters",description:"By Kathryn Henne, Jenna Harb",content:"Harb, Jenna, Kathryn Henne. \u0026ldquo;Disinformation and Resistance in the Surveillance of Indigenous Protesters.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century.

Such practices have garnered public attention in light of recent events. This chapter reflects on two examples: protests against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline that crossed over the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the United States and the release of details regarding Project SITKA—a Canadian Royal Mounted Police “dataveillance” operation identifying and tracking Indigenous activists. It examines them to illuminate the strategic use of information, particularly disinformation and misinformation, by government actors, media, private security personnel, and protesters. In particular, the analysis highlights how settler colonialism informs the asymmetrical power dynamics at work, illustrating connections between Project SITKA and the Standing Rock protests.\nKeywords: Keywords: Knowledge; Security\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:51,href:"/archive/globalization_and_the_rise_of_integrated_world_society_deterritorialization/",title:"Globalization and the Rise of Integrated World Society: Deterritorialization, Structural-Power, and the Endogenization of International Society.",description:"By Salvatore Babones, John H.S.

Nonetheless, world society remains an amorphous and undertheorized concept, and its potential role in shaping the structure of the international society of states has scarcely been raised. We build on Buzan\u0026rsquo;s (2018, 2) master concept of \u0026lsquo;integrated\u0026rsquo; world society (\u0026lsquo;a label to describe the merger of world and interstate society\u0026rsquo;) to locate the integration of world society in the globalization of social networks. Following the advice of Buzan (2001) and Williams (2014), we use conceptual frameworks from international political economy to systematically explore the structure of integrated world society along six dimensions derived from Mann (1986) and Strange (1988): military/security, political, economic/production, credit, knowledge, and ideological. Our empirical survey suggests that, on each of these dimensions, power has centralized as it has globalized, generating steep global hierarchies in world society that are similar to those that characterize national societies. The centrality of the United States in the networks of world society makes it in effect the \u0026lsquo;central state\u0026rsquo; of a new kind of international society that is endogenized within integrated world society.\nKeywords: Globalization; Structural Power, Power; Money and Finance; Security; General Framework\n"}),a.add({id:52,href:"/archive/information_technology_and_control_in_a_changing_world_understanding_power_structures_in_the_21st_century/",title:"Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century",description:"Edited by Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov",content:"Haggart, Blayne, Kate Henne, Natasha Tusikov, editors.

Strange\u0026rsquo;s key weakness is the failure to account for her knowledge structure\u0026rsquo;s regulative form relative to her security, production and financial structures. We seek to develop Strange\u0026rsquo;s account through the addition of Manuel Castells' account of digital network structures. Castells' morphogenic structural approach to digital network power helps to clarify the mechanisms by which today\u0026rsquo;s knowledge structure achieves autonomy, internal regulation and generative capacity. This sociological completion of Strange\u0026rsquo;s theory, an international socio-political economy approach as it were, better explains the capacity and limits of today\u0026rsquo;s digital network knowledge structure to resist reduction to other structural interests. Strange\u0026rsquo;s non-reductive structural approach to power is significant for sociology as it helps identify \u0026lsquo;social order\u0026rsquo; in a global age, but an additional sociological dimension is also necessary for the fulfilment of Strange\u0026rsquo;s theoretical project.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Production; Security; Money and Finance; General Framework\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:56,href:"/archive/precarious_ownership_of_the_internet_of_things_in_the_age_of_data/",title:"Precarious Ownership of the Internet of Things in the Age of Data",description:"By Natasha Tusikov",content:"Tusikov, Natasha. \u0026ldquo;Precarious Ownership of the Internet of Things in the Age of Data.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century.

Drawing upon a knowledge regulation framework influenced by Susan Strange, this chapter argues that the IoT industry exemplifies the central role that knowledge governance now plays in the global political economy. The chapter examines how companies that own the knowledge integral to the IoT’s functionality (the software) control that knowledge through intellectual property laws, especially copyright, and the ubiquitous surveillance of their customers. These companies retain control over the software even after its purchase, meaning they have a newly expanded regulatory capacity to monitor and control how their products are used. The private post-purchase control that IoT companies exert over smart goods represents a significant change in private actors’ regulatory capacity to set rules governing knowledge.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Production\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:57,href:"/archive/reflection_i/",title:"Reflection I",description:"By Randall Germain",content:"RGermain, Randall. \u0026ldquo;Reflection I.\u0026rdquo; In Information, Technology and Control in a Changing World: Understanding Power Structures in the 21st Century.

This chapter explores the practices of building the infrastructure to monitor welfare beneficiaries, many of whom are vulnerable or marginalised populations. To do so, the chapter examines the Aadhaar system in India, which has issued over one billion unique identification numbers since being launched in 2010. The analysis illustrates a one-way expectation of knowledge and transparency (i.e., for citizens to disclose in order to access services), drawing attention to how nationalist agendas and forms of inequality inform who is subject to the state’s terms and conditions. In doing so, it considers how these forms of surveillance evince broader shifts in which state and non-state actors rely on knowledge to regulate subjects.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Security\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:63,href:"/archive/weaponising_copyright_cultural_governance_and_regulating_speech_in_the_knowledge_economy/",title:"Weaponising Copyright: Cultural Governance and Regulating Speech in the Knowledge Economy",description:"By Debora J.

After an exploration of copyright governance within the context of Susan Strange’s knowledge structure framework, this chapter discusses cultural governance through copyright as a mode of censorship. I take up two recent examples where copyright was weaponised to curb speech. The first is an effort to control the speech of a controversial YouTube star. The second is an effort to curb the association of a cartoon character with white supremacy. In both cases, copyright performs a normative, not commercial, function, as copyright owners exert their control over their creative work to limit the expression of others. There is much to be troubled by regarding both the resurgence of white supremacy and the use of copyright to shape what can and cannot be expressed.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Security\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:64,href:"/archive/developing_disaster_power_structural_violence_insurance-linked_securities_and_the_international_political_economy_of_the_disaster_politics_nexus/",title:"Developing Disaster: Power, Structural Violence, Insurance-Linked Securities, and the International Political Economy of the Disaster Politics Nexus.",description:"By Korey Pasch",content:"Pasch, Korey. \u0026ldquo;Developing Disaster: Power, Structural Violence, Insurance-Linked Securities, and the International Political Economy of the Disaster Politics Nexus.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Natural Resources 8 nos. 1\u0026amp;2 (2018): 131-153.\nThis article presents an alternative framing of disasters as a form of structural violence resulting from the unequal distribution of structural power between various groups, organizations, institutions, and states in the contemporary global political economy.

Placing U.S. copyright and Internet policy in a historical context and using Susan Strange\u0026rsquo;s concepts of structural power and knowledge structures, we argue that copyright and Internet policies cannot be analyzed in isolation, but are intimately and inextricably linked forms of knowledge regulation. All knowledge regulation policies involve balancing access and restriction. Our analysis suggests that the current U.S. policy of Internet freedom and strong copyright protection represents a particular, historically situated strategy designed to exert structural power in the global information economy: Free flow of information creates markets by exposure to intellectual properties, while copyright secures economic benefit to copyright holders from the flow. We argue that a full and honest debate over issues of information access requires acknowledgment of contemporary and conflicting values, with the realization that different societies and interests will weigh access and dissemination differently. Recognizing as legitimate and incorporating these different perspectives into the global governance structures of the Internet comprise the key challenge facing those who favor truly democratic global Internet governance.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Internet Governance; Theory; Structural Power, Power\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:67,href:"/archive/introduction_to_the_special_issue_rise/",title:"Introduction to the Special Issue: Rise of the 'Knowledge Structure': Implications for the Exercise of Power in the Global Political Economy",description:"By Blayne Haggart",content:"Haggart, Blayne. \u0026ldquo;Introduction to the Special Issue: Rise of the ‘Knowledge Structure’: Implications for the Exercise of Power in the Global Political Economy.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Information Policy 7 (2017): 164-175.\nSomewhat paradoxically, the implications of knowledge governance\u0026rsquo;s changing role for the exercise of power in the Information Age remains underappreciated outside those scholars and policymakers directly engaged with these specific areas.

Global environmental problems, global financial crises, and global inequalities are three of the small set of global problems regularly pointed to by promoters of the new global public policy degree programs established over the last decade. In the contemporary world, the knowledge structure serves the production and financial structures, not the other way around. Strange\u0026rsquo;s analysis contains an argument about the recent wave of economic globalization. She sees the globalization of private finance and the globalization of production as, in part, responses to changes in technology to things like containerized shipping and the Internet changes that came from that contemporary knowledge structure. The programs like the one that Mahbubani created at NUS with Kofi Annan reflect a global governance paradigm that emphasizes subsidiary as a way to enhance both accountability and legitimacy.\nKeywords: Global Governance; Structural Power, Power; General Framework\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:69,href:"/archive/corporate_power_in_a_global_economy/",title:"Corporate Power in a Global Economy",description:"By Ronen Palan",content:"Palan, Ronen. \u0026ldquo;Corporate Power in a Global Economy.\u0026rdquo; In Susan Strange and the Future of Global Political Economy: Power, Control and Transformation.

These theories assumed that an existential condition of scarcity (of material or ideational goods) encourages the formation of collective action groups, each intent on advancing or protecting their vested interests.

We argued that States had moved far from the days when suspicion of the multinationals' power had interfered with bargaining relationships, to a position where incentives were being showered on the firms to influence their decisions about where to invest.

However, as she often argued in the 1990s, the political system is now failing in three areas: the states system is increasingly unable to manage instability in the global financial system; the sovereign system is unable to deal effectively with globalised environmental problems; and lastly the political system\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the global market is producing widening socio-economic inequality across the global system. However, only by understanding the role of non-state authority through the study of both international and comparative political economy and a move away from International Relation\u0026rsquo;s state-centricism can the Westfailure system be understood and alternatives assessed.\nReprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy.

Arguing that the authors (like others) miss the deterritorialisation of commercial power in the global system, Strange allows that there needs to be a corrective to the extreme globalisation thesis of complete transformation, but that a failure to examine what is really happening in the global political economy, while relying on aggregated and out-of-date statistics has led too many political economists to fail to recognise the very real changes in the balance of power between multinational corporations and states.

She suggests that the key problem has not been the indebtedness of poor states itself, but the sorts of credit historically extended and the timidity of the solutions to the problems that have arisen. Noting the missed opportunity of a new Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, she notes not only is there little agreement on the causes of problems but also little consensus about \u0026lsquo;what is to be done\u0026rsquo;.\nKeywords: Money and Finance\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:90,href:"/archive/what_theory_the_theory_in_mad_money/",title:"What Theory?

Stopford, 1991) and The Retreat of the State (1996) to argue that the disciplines of International Relations and International Economics fail to understand contemporary globalisation. Where IR scholars have missed the structural shifts in the global system away from state-centric power with the emergence of new non-state authority, economists have missed the role of the state in promoting these changes, and misunderstand the working of global markets, discounting, or not even recognising the political relations between firms, what Strange refers to as the new diplomacy. In this last piece Strange revisits the criticisms she has levelled at much of mainstream International Studies literature and remains as angry as ever at the myopia of many of her contemporaries, leading to a failure to recognise the real problems of the \u0026lsquo;global casino\u0026rsquo;, not least of all issues of finance and technology.\nKeywords: Authority; Markets; Money and Finance; States; Theory; Technology; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:91,href:"/archive/who_are_eu_ambiguities/",title:"Who are EU?

Strange then discusses European trade policy (which needs to be more predictable), investment policy (which should be more open), European Monetary Union (which while stabilising may have little effect on inward investment from non-European investors), and welfare issues (which need to continue to cushion technological-unemployment). Strange concludes that while states (and the European Union) cannot directly intervene in markets successfully, they can act as \u0026lsquo;good landlords\u0026rsquo; to encourage the location of activities on their territory, and by doing so gain the benefits which Reich suggests are possible.\nKeywords: Europe; Money and Finance; Production; Trade; European Integration\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:92,href:"/archive/why_do_international_organisations_never_die/",title:"Why do International Organisations Never Die?",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Why do International Organisations Never Die?.\u0026rdquo; In Autonomous Policy Making by International Organisations, Bob Reinalda, Bertjan Verbeek, editors. 213-220. London: Routledge, 1998.\nIn this concluding chapter of a collection of articles drawn from a series of workshops organised under the auspices of the ECPR, Strange reflects on the legacy of The Anatomy of Influence (see \u0026lsquo;‘IMF: Monetary Managers’ [1974]) and suggests that a focus on international organisation remains a largely European enterprise due to the continuing dominance of liberal institutionalism and (neo)Realism. After applauding the project in the first section, she then turns to some criticisms of the collection\u0026rsquo;s contributors. She suggests that some of the authors have been unable to avoid capture by their subjects and are too kind to the self-perpetuating bureaucracies and secretariats of many international organisations. She argues that these bureaucracies have a symbiotic relationship with the members\u0026rsquo; governments and thus are able to ride out many local problems. Lastly she briefly alludes (again) to the failure to include the impact of changes in market conditions, changes in technology and the role of MNCs in the international political economic analysis of international organisations.\nKeywords: Corporations; Europe; International Institutions; Theory; Transnational Corporations\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:93,href:"/archive/an_international_political_economy_perspective/",title:"An International Political Economy Perspective",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;An International Political Economy Perspective.\u0026rdquo; In Governments, Globalization, and International Business, John H. Dunning, editor. 132-145. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.\nIn this chapter Strange lays out her idea of what International Political Economy is, including a wide-ranging view of politics (not just the activities of politicians and governments) and a focus on structural power. This then leads her to discuss the problems that globalisation presents for governments, business and people. She concludes that these problems require a re-examination of authority and justice both by states and by international business and adopting an IPE perspective facilitates such analysis. By trying to make a bridge between business research and international relations Strange returns again to the theme of breaking down disciplinary boundaries, see for instance \u0026lsquo;International Political Economy: Reuniting three fields of intellectual endeavour\u0026rsquo; (1989).\nKeywords: Globalization; Political Economy; Theory\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:94,href:"/archive/globalisation_and_capitalist_diversity_expieriences/",title:"Globalisation and Capitalist Diversity: Experiences on the Asian Mainland",description:"Edited By Susan Strange",content:"Susan Strange, editor.

Strange herself only contributed an introduction outlining the papers in the volume and discussing the organisational background to the conference. Strange argues that comparative politics scholars and international business academics need to \u0026lsquo;build bridges\u0026rsquo; between the two disciplines to better understand the interaction between states and firms. Additionally Strange wanted the conference to bring together European and Japanese academics to discuss the relationship between firms and states in Asia\u0026rsquo;s economic development. Unsurprisingly, this relationship between states and firms, most specifically in the case of Japan and China was the central subject of discussion. However Strange concludes that while the papers collected in the volume broadly agreed on the importance of Asian development for the global economy, the participants were unable to agree on the interaction of states and firms. Finally Strange suggested that mainstream realist and neo-realist approaches to international relations were of little help and what was required was an interdisciplinary comparative international political economy, which she had been advocating for the previous twenty years.\nKeywords: Political Economy; Theory; Realism\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:95,href:"/archive/territory_state_authority_and_economy/",title:"Territory, State, Authority and Economy: A New Realist Ontology of Global Political Economy",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Territory, State, Authority and Economy: A New Realist Ontology of Global Political Economy.\u0026rdquo; In The New Realism: Perspectives on Multilateralism and World Order, Robert W. Cox, editor. 3-19. Basingstoke: Macmillan Press/ United Nations University Press, 1997.\nStrange argues that the global economy is in the midst of a transition; the close incidence of political authority, economic activity and geographical territory no longer holds. This has been caused by two main groups of factors: firstly changes derived from science and technology; and secondly structural changes within the global finance structure. Authority has shifted, or is shifting, from states to other actors in the international political economy. She disputes Rosenau\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis of the emergence of a second world of turbulent complexity, disturbing the old world of international relations, instead arguing that it is all the same world, just more complex!\nReprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy.

She then goes on to outline three dilemmas of globalisation: the economic, in that increasingly there is no political authority able to govern and control market relations; the environmental, while on one hand market actors are driven by the profit motive to use up environmental resources, countervailing power is largely absent; the political, there is a major democratic deficit in the governance structure of the global system. Strange then links these aspects of globalisation to technical change and increased mobility of capital. However, a concentration on the state misses the \u0026lsquo;new diplomacy\u0026rsquo; between firms and other non-state actors as well as states themselves as outline in Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M. Stopford, 1991) . She then restates briefly her argument from The Retreat of the State (1996), the state is losing its authority due to: the decline in importance of war-making and security; its inability to control the value of the currency; and its increasingly lack of credibility as a provider of welfare. Thus, to deny the decline of the state is to deny that something needs to be done about it unless big business is to come to rule the international system.\nKeywords: Authority; Globalization; Markets; States; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:97,href:"/archive/the_future_of_global_capitalism/",title:"The Future of Global Capitalism: or Will Divergence Persist Forever",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Future of Global Capitalism: or Will Divergence Persist Forever.\u0026rdquo; In The Political Economy of Modern Capitalism. Capping Convergence and Diversity, Colin Crouch, Wolfgang Streeck, editors. 182-191. London: Sage, 1997.\nIn this response to the contents of the volume in which it appears, Strange distances herself from comparative political economists studying different forms of national capitalism, and argues for a global perception of a more systemic view of capitalism. She notes that technological change and the mobility of capital and knowledge have produced a number of overlapping diversities in different sectors rather than a single state based set of diversities. The new institutional approach misses not only these changes but also the decline of governments ability to influence economic organisation, the growing disparity between the power of states and of multinationals, and the increase in bond financing (as a substitute for taxation) which is problematic for investment. Overall Strange is dismissive of a focus on diversity suggesting the more important problems will be the result of the increasing convergence of capitalism.\nKeywords: Global Governance; Knowledge; Theory; Global System; Technology\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:98,href:"/archive/the_problem_of_the_solution_capitalism/",title:"The Problem of the Solution?

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.\nAgain Strange criticises International Relations for not focusing on the systemic problems, not least of all environmental and financial issues which a concern for inter-state relations misses. Thus International Political Economy is open to approaches from political geography, historical sociology and elsewhere that have not been fixated on the relations between states as the key causal factor in the global system. Globalised production and finance are integrating most areas into a global system and it is the system not states which analysis should focus on in the future.\nKeywords: Global Governance; Globalization; Money and Finance; Production; International Relations; Global System\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:99,href:"/archive/a_reply_to_chris_may/",title:"A Reply to Chris May",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;A Reply to Chris May.\u0026rdquo; Global Society 10, no. 3 (1996): 303-305.\nIn Strange\u0026rsquo;s reply to May\u0026rsquo;s article (Strange Fruit: Susan Strange\u0026rsquo;s theory of Structural-Power in the International Political Economy Global Society 10, 2 (May 1996): 167 -189), she engages with two criticisms made of her theory of structural power. Firstly she suggests that the knowledge structure itself is not necessarily prior as is suggested it might be considered to be if her process of agenda setting power is regarded as central. Furthermore my reworking of the knowledge structure while suggestive was overly dependent on a de-contextualised reading of Schumacher, whom she knew personally and whose views are misrepresented. Secondly, while agreeing with the criticism that she lacks a general theory of change she asserts that such a general theory is not possible, noting that she is however sensitive to particular forms of change. Finally, she concludes by agreeing that Paul Feyerabend\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;methodological anarchism\u0026rsquo; is helpful in giving epistemological grounds for her eclectic approach.\nKeywords: Knowledge; Structural Power, Power; Theory\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:100,href:"/archive/europes_future_in_the_global_political_economy/",title:"Europe's Future in the Global Political Economy",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Europe\u0026rsquo;s Future in the Global Political Economy.\u0026rdquo; In Reflections on the Identity of Europe: Global Transatlantic Perspectives, Thomas Row, editor. Bologna: The John Hopkins University Bologna Center, 1996.\nStrange argues in this reflection on the future of Europe that too little analytical attention has been paid to the corporate sector and its role in three important structural shifts in the global political economy: new and faster technological changes that have speeded up the competitive cycle (and reduced the time for investors to recover their outlay on innovation); moves in finance towards a much more globalised financial sector with a reduction in the role of national (or in this case European Union) policy interventions; and a shift in the location of production, facilitated by the other two changes. This, she argues, means that the chief dimension of difference in the global political economy is no longer state political but rather is related to corporate activity and interest. In the face of the relative inaction (caused by political sclerosis at the EU), she argues that to understand the political economy, analysts can no longer ignore or simplify the political economy of the private sector but rather need to include corporations as a central element of their analysis; There is no longer a European orientation to the global political economy separate from the role and activity of international business.\nKeywords: Corporations; Europe; Money and Finance; Production; Technology; Transnational Corporations\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:101,href:"/archive/strange_fruit_susan_stranges_theory_of_structural_power_in_the_international_political_economy/",title:"Strange fruit: Susan Strange's theory of structural power in the international political economy",description:"By Christopher May",content:"Christopher May.

The Retreat of the State: State Diffusion of Power in the World Economy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.\nIn what might effectively be regarded as the third part of a trilogy, together with States and Markets (1988) and Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M. Stopford, 1991), Strange examines states' transition towards the sidelines of global political economic relations. Though in the past authority might have been state based, now she argues it is more often based on non-state abilities to bring about (or structure) outcomes. This has to some extent been obscured by the increasing intervention by states in the lives of their citizens, giving an impression of the retention of power. While some states have fared better than others, the US being the prime example of a state retaining significant power, in general Strange sees new sites of authority in the global system are rising to challenge even the strongest states. Relations between states and non-state authority are arrayed along a continuum from the Mafia, threatening and undermining remaining state authority, to the big-six accountancy firms and transnational legal partnerships which work with state based authority and by doing so support it. Lacking the means to autonomously change its interactions with the global political economy, the state has lost the most important and significant aspect of its potential.\nKeywords: Foundational Work; States; Structural Power, Power; Theory; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link, Open Access)\n"}),a.add({id:103,href:"/archive/1995_presidential_address_isa_as_a_microcosm/",title:"1995 Presidential Address: ISA as a Microcosm",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;1995 Presidential Address: ISA as a Microcosm.\u0026rdquo; International Studies Quality 39, no. 3 (1995): 289-295.\nAfter briefly discussing the history of the ISA, Strange points out that it is the International Studies Association, despite the current domination of International Relations. Once again Strange argues for the constructive engagement with other discipline interested in the international system, from political geographers to business economists. Strange points to the relative decline of state-state violence relative to civil and local violence, the increasing interest in the environment, and the dangers stemming from the financial markets, as reasons for widening the ISA\u0026rsquo;s implicit agenda. Stressing that in the post-Cold War world there is only one superpower, Strange argues that for millions America is a common second-country. This is a very powerful position to be in, but it also requires the US. to remain part of the world system - not to flee into isolationism.

She argues that it may now be beyond any nationally elected government (even in the US.) to re-impose its hegemonic intent on other states. But some co-ordinated pressure from Japanese and European policy bodies may support the reintroduction into global politics of a more interdependent (and less free-market) approach to commercial and financial diplomacy.

Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995.\nNoting that it is over twenty years since she and others argued for the end of the false division between politics and economics, Strange argues that the development of modern IPE has been in reaction to events within the global system. She suggests that there is still a division between an American IPE based conception of the Politics of International Economic Relations, and a non-American approach that bears some similarity to her own framework as laid out in States and Markets (1988) and elsewhere. She once again makes many of the criticisms she has detailed before regarding the discipline\u0026rsquo;s deference to international economics. Strange suggests the way forward is to conceptualise politics more widely, building on the work of moral philosophers and to apply her conception of structural power, as well as the more usual considerations of relational power.\nKeywords: Political Economy; Structural Power, Power; Theory; International Relations\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:106,href:"/archive/the_defective_state/",title:"The Defective State",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"SStrange, Susan \u0026ldquo;The Defective State.\u0026rdquo; Daedelus 124, no. 2 (1995): 55-74.\nStrange argues that while states remain superficially important as major actors within the global system, the underlying power relations have hollowed out their authority. This authority has in some cases flowed \u0026lsquo;upwards\u0026rsquo; to international institutions, and in other cases flowed down to markets (and also more localised organisations). These movements have led to an asymmetry of structural authority in the global system. Strange also makes some comments regarding the state-centric nature of the discipline of International Relations and suggests a new research agenda based around her conception of structural power and the importance of non-state actors in the functioning of authority. Thus while competition between states continues in some sense, it has been joined by other fields of competition that the disciplines of International Relations and International Political Economy need to contend with if they are to remain relevant to the global political economy.\nKeywords: Corporations; International Institutions; States; Structural Power, Power; Transnational Corporations\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:107,href:"/archive/the_limits_of_politics/",title:"The Limits of Politics",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;The Limits of Politics.\u0026rdquo; Government and Opposition 30, no. 3 (1995): 291-311.\nOriginally delivered as a lecture at the LSE this article finds Strange explicitly engaging with the notion of globalisation. For Strange globalisation is: the development of products for explicitly global and transnational markets; the decline of barriers and distinctions between national economies; the emergence of at least partial labour mobility in addition to the more recognised capital mobility; and the speeding up of transport and communications. While these trends have changed the balance between authority and markets over outcomes in the international political economy, they have also led to an increasingly globalised but asymmetrical array of structural power.\nKeywords: Authority; Globalization; Markets; Theory; Structural Power, Power; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:108,href:"/archive/finance_and_capitalism/",title:"Finance and Capitalism: The City's Imperial Role Yesterday and Today",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;Finance and Capitalism: The City\u0026rsquo;s Imperial Role Yesterday and Today.\u0026rdquo; Review of International Studies 20, no. 4 (1994): 407-410.\nIn this short review of P.J.

Oxford: Blackwell, 1994.\nStrange argues as she has frequently done for the importance of historical understanding power in the international financial structure is to be fully analysed. She suggests that there are two separate but linked aspects of the global political economy that need to be thought about within the financial structure - the international monetary system and the international financial system. Thus, Strange focuses on credit creation to examine the upheavals in the financial structure and the decline of the Bretton Woods system. She also suggests that acquiescence in the uneven distribution of the benefits derived from financial \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; may be becoming less assured in the post Cold War global system. While larger states have (at least for the time being) managed to retain some of their power in the financial structure, smaller states have seen a decline in their ability to resist the pressures from the international money markets. Once again Strange discusses the shift in power from states to markets, and implicitly reinforces her arguments for the centrality of structural power considerations.\nKeywords: Authority; Markets; Money and Finance; States; Structural Power, Power; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:111,href:"/archive/global_government_and_global_opposition/",title:"Global Government and Global Opposition",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Global Government and Global Opposition.\u0026rdquo; In Politics in an Interdependent World, Geraint Parry, editor. 20-33.

She suggests that the deterriotrialisation of power and the increasing importance of \u0026lsquo;diplomacy\u0026rsquo; between firms as laid out in Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M. Stopford, 1991), argues for a more complex view of \u0026lsquo;interdependence\u0026rsquo;. She then highlights three central issues: the idea that the operations of multinationals might be understood as a parallel and competing tax and welfare system to that previously operated by states; this relative loss of control over social functions by states has led to reduced stability in the global economy; and lastly societies have increasingly lost their ability to make autonomous decisions concerning methods of and priorities of governance. She then links this analysis to the re-emergence of Euroscepticism, before finally identifying some possible groups that may offer opposition to these tendencies, namely environmentalism, feminism, fundamentalism and regionalism.\nKeywords: Corporations; States; Structural Power, Power; Theory; Authority vs Markets\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:112,href:"/archive/rethinking_structural_change/",title:"Rethinking Structural Change in the International Political Economy: States, Firms and Diplomacy",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Rethinking Structural Change in the International Political Economy: States, Firms and Diplomacy.\u0026rdquo; In Political Economy and the Changing Global Order, Richard Stubbs, Geoffrey R.D.

Oslo and Oxford: Scandinavian University Press and Oxford University Press, 1994.\nOnce again Strange argues at length that the notion of American decline in the global system is mistaken if examined through her structural perspective. She presents a brief history of the previous fifty years to explore how America\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;fall\u0026rsquo; can be proposed and why this misunderstands power in the global system. She uses this insight to argue for an International Political Economy approach to the problem of American hegemony, but she also warns that technological changes feeding into structural changes may make drawing lessons from the decline of previous hegemons difficult if not impossible. She concludes that while structural change may offer the best chance for a more just and peaceful system, it may also open up the possibility of extensive disorder and insecurity in the future, leading to problems of legitimate rule and authority.\nKeywords: Hegemony; Structural Power, Power; United States\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:115,href:"/archive/the_power_gap_member_states_and_the_world_economy/",title:"The Power Gap: Member States and the World Economy",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Power Gap: Member States and the World Economy.\u0026rdquo; In Economic Policy Making and the European Union, Frank Brouwer, Valerio Linter, Mike Newman, editors. 19-26. London: Federal Trust, 1994.\nStrange criticises arguments that suggest the European Union is a sui generis political institution. She criticises such claims, self avowedly, not from a lengthy engagement with European political analysis, but from a more global concern with political economy. She suggests that except for the Commission there is little to distinguish the EU from some other intergovernmental organisations. And given the Commission\u0026rsquo;s inability to move on anything but essentially trivial matters she remains sceptical of the entire European project, remaining as she contends merely a sophisticated free-trade area. The problem, however, is not a particularly European one; the decline of state power vis-a-vis the global economy has been evident for some time. Only by recognising the problems for sovereign political authorities in the global political economy and planning for new constitutional developments in Europe to address this problem can this \u0026lsquo;power gap\u0026rsquo; be narrowed. Strange here implicitly draws on the elements of her work that have supported the \u0026lsquo;state-in-decline\u0026rsquo; thesis even though at other times she seems less willing to accept the absolute decline of state power than such arguments suggest.\nKeywords: Europe; Global Governance; States; Global System; European Integration\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:116,href:"/archive/the_structure_of__finance_in_the_world_system/",title:"The Structure of  Finance in the World System",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Structure of Finance in the World System.\u0026rdquo; In Global Transformation: Challenges to the State System, Yoshikazu Sakamoto, editor. 228-249. Tokyo: United Nations University Press, 1994.\nStrange again stresses, as she has done before, that the crucial element of the financial structure is the ability to create credit. This is only one side of the financial structure, however - the other side is the institutional regulation of exchange rates between currencies. Much of the work on the international financial has been compromised by its emphasis on the state due to the fore grounding of the exchange rate part of the structure. Strange then suggests and describes five key changes in the structure: its growth in size; new technologies; the penetration of national financial systems by global financial capital; the increasing competition and declining regulation in credit provision; and the relation between supply and demand. Using a global monetarist perspective Strange sees global inflation linked with the oversupply of credit by banks, stemming from the previous four changes. However, American power in the financial structure still remains, measured by their ability to act unilaterally in the field of global finance.\nReprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy.

She then briefly summarises her arguments regarding structural power before discussing the roles states have historically played as producers of security, credit, market relations and environment. The power over finance and environment has moved to centre stage, but states have been losing relative power over these areas. But this is not to agree with the America-in-decline writers. Rather Strange argues that the US. retains structural power, which the non-US Group of Seven states, through joint action need to encourage Americans to recognise. This will enable the US. to once again act as hegemon for the general good. America\u0026rsquo;s ability to supply market public goods needs to be matched by its will to do so, through diplomatic pressure. This is one of the few pieces where Strange makes her underlying prescriptive stance on the need for American leadership completely explicit.\nReprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy.

However, here she argues that the transformation of the world economy is not so much the product of state/firm interactions, rather it is firms that are playing (and will continue to play) the more important role in structural change. This finally represents a complete reversal of the position of \u0026lsquo;Follow-up commentary On Money and World Politics\u0026rsquo; (1984). Strange also argues that the supposed problems of the emergence of trading blocs (the three main blocs being centred on the US, Japan and Europe - the triad) are not crucial to the stability of the global economy, as she had implicitly argued in her discussions of protectionism. The problems and structural transformation of the global economy are rooted in the financial structure, and it is here that the US needs to assert its leadership for the future good of the international system.\nKeywords: Corporations; Global Governance; Hegemony; Structural Power, Power; Theory; Transnational Corporations; Global System\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:120,href:"/archive/take_six_eggs_theory_finance_and_the_real_economy_in_the_work_of_susan_strange/",title:"'Take six eggs': theory, finance, and the real economy in the work of Susan Strange",description:"By Robert W.

This decline in the importance in territory has engendered among other things an international business civilisation that is based on firms and enterprises rather than nationality. However this seems to be different from the transnational empire she suggests in \u0026lsquo;Towards a Theory of Transnational Empire\u0026rsquo; (1989). This central change in the international political economy, has led to a diffusion of state power, but still leaves the US the most powerful actor in the world. Strange argues that power is shifting from a territorial state basis, to a transnational enterprise basis. However this power is geographical, centred on such cities as New York and Los Angeles, not as before on Washington DC. This article marks a significant step towards the analysis of firms as being as important as states for Strange\u0026rsquo;s IPE, fully developed in Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M.

The transnational empire she identifies is centred on the \u0026lsquo;court\u0026rsquo; in Washington DC, and she argues that new studies of empire are needed to understand this new type of transnational empire.

Firstly, state procurement can be used as a stimulus to research and development and secondly the control of market access can be used as a bargaining lever. Unless the single market is used in this way, and a common defence policy is adopted, along with centralised procurement, then Strange envisages Europe (even with closer union) still loosing out to the Americans and Japanese.

However while she call this the \u0026lsquo;American Empire\u0026rsquo; her argument is (self-avowedly) close to an international Gramscian \u0026lsquo;historical bloc\u0026rsquo; analysis.

Though she originally cited empirical data, in response to the criticism from Milner and Snyder that this evidence left her arguments unproved, Strange answered that the real evidence to prove her argument empirically would be too difficult to collect, though in theory it could be possible to compile. What seems clear from this exchange, is that Strange is not dealing with \u0026lsquo;evidence\u0026rsquo; in its strict form and has a permissive view towards its acceptability.\nKeywords: Hegemony; Structural Power, Power; Theory\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:140,href:"/archive/the_persistent_myth_of_lost_hegemony/",title:"The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony.\u0026rdquo; International Organisation 41, no. 4 (1987): 551-574.\nStrange\u0026rsquo;s classic attack of the \u0026lsquo;declinist school\u0026rsquo; in international relations. Once she has discussed the more \u0026lsquo;sociological\u0026rsquo; reasons for American academics holding this view (of which the most powerful/cynical is that it is essentially a convenient denial of responsibility by Americans for their effect on the international system), Strange goes on to elaborate the four structures of power in IPE. This exposition closely parallels (though in a brief form) the arguments that appear in States and Markets (1988). Strange again identifies the American domestic political process (and constitutional structure) as being the root of many of international problems. Strange suggests that the domestic and international cannot be separated analytically, and her structural analysis of power explains the effects of American domestic politics on the international political economy. An earlier version was given in a conference paper presented to the 30th Annual Conference of the Japan Association of International Relations in Tokyo, October 1986.\nReprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy.

This work represents a detailed sectoral history and analysis which argues against many of the proposed solutions to the international economic crisis she identifies. Strange argues that the United States must once again take up the leadership role (which it enjoys by virtue of economic preponderance) and more radically suggests that in the future financial regulation of credit creating agencies should not be a territorially based jurisdiction, but based on the currencies themselves wherever the credit transactions take place. Using her analysis, locating and understanding \u0026lsquo;key decisions\u0026rsquo; in one sector/structure of power in the international political economy, Strange shows how disruption has spread to affect the other structures, and concludes with suggestions for how constitutional and governmental changes in the United States would benefit the international system.

Oxford: Basil Blackwell for the College of Europe, 1986.\nStrange identifies two main obstructions to a constructive dialogue between the United States and Europe over international trade: America\u0026rsquo;s lack of interest in maintaining a steady provision of credit to the interdependent international system; and Europe\u0026rsquo;s inability to take responsibility for its own defence and security, and therefore reducing its dependence on America. This leads Strange to conclude that the U.S. has abused rather than lost its power in the international economy, refusing to allow the separation the international risks from domestic bank activities in developing countries, taking no notice of the Brandt\u0026rsquo;s commissions call for a independent multilateral financial institution, and not taking the role of international lender of last resort. This refusal led to the upheavals which the system was then experiencing. Underlying these problems is the lack of political will on behalf of the United States government to act as a responsible hegemon. Thus the problem is not declining US power, but rather the lack of a counter-balance from Europe, a theme she first explored at length in \u0026lsquo;Cuba and After\u0026rsquo; (1963) and to which she would return to in \u0026lsquo;The Persistence of Problems in EC-US Relations\u0026rsquo; (1989) and elsewhere.\nKeywords: Money and Finance; Hegemony; Europe; United States\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:144,href:"/archive/reaganomics_the_third_world_and_the_future/",title:"Reaganomics, the Third World and the Future",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Reaganomics, the Third World and the Future.\u0026rdquo; In Third World Affairs 1986, Raana Gauhar, editors. 65-72.

She then presents a short history of U.S. economic policy towards the Third World and the global system as a whole. This allows her to emphasise the structural power approach that she would develop at some length in States and Markets (1988) and argue that while many on the left see America\u0026rsquo;s influence as entirely malign, she sees good and bad in its domination of the international system. She concludes the main problem is uncertainty regarding U.S. policy, which while leading to rational responses (risk-avoiding devices, such as hedging) in the financial structure. However, these responses also bring with them a shadow (speculation, gambling and both political and economic recklessness) which produces further financial instability for the system and most particularly Third World countries.\nKeywords: Hegemony; Money and Finance; Structural Power, Power\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:145,href:"/archive/supranationals_and_the_state/",title:"Supranationals and the State",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Supranationals and the State.\u0026rdquo; In States in History, John A.

The central argument is that transnationals - TNCs and international organisations - both support and undermine states at the same time. There is a paradoxical symbiosis, that is under-examined due to most writers discussing either support roles or undermining roles. In addition there has been a shift in the basis of economic power, from land and power to capital and knowledge. Clearly this part of Strange\u0026rsquo;s larger argument about the transnational power of capital and American TNCs, and represents the beginning of a shift away from the position suggesting a final authority of states over transnationals in Paths to International Political Economy (1984).\nKeywords: Corporations; Knowledge; Theory; Corporations; Knowledge Production\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:146,href:"/archive/the_bondage_of_liberal_economics/",title:"The Bondage of Liberal Economics",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan \u0026ldquo;The Bondage of Liberal Economics.\u0026rdquo; SAIS Review 6, no. 1 (1986): 25-38.\nHere Strange returns again to the inadequacy of economics in its analysis of international trade, made in \u0026lsquo;International Trade\u0026rsquo; (1955) and \u0026lsquo;International money matters\u0026rsquo; (1970), and elsewhere.

This in the main is because they are already tacitly included, but there is little engagement with the economist\u0026rsquo;s prioritising of efficiency or the International Relations scholar\u0026rsquo;s of peace.

She suggests that the world economic crisis has three interrelated aspects: unemployment, ‘flagging trade’, and unstable money. As in ‘The Management of Surplus Capacity: Or how does theory stand up to protectionism 1970s style?’ (1979) she shows some scepticism to the arguments that demonise protectionism, and suggests this is an essentially ideological position that would not repay global implementation. After briefly rehearsing the global financial history of the previous decade, Strange suggests that financial regulation which in the last analysis is dependent on certain sovereign states, can never be disinterested. As she would argue in more extended analyses later, she sees the role of the American financial system as destabilising because of the priority it gives to the interests of the domestic political system. Indeed until the United States is willing to ‘lead’ the global system, instead of working in its own interest, those interests will be compromised. Strange, as she would do often in future works, suggests a pragmatic acceptance of American reach over the global system, and suggests a sort of civilising mission to educate them into responsible leadership.\nKeywords: Europe, Hegemony, Money and Finance, United States\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:161,href:"/archive/cave_hic_dragones_a_critique_of_regime_analysis/",title:"Cave!

As such it has at least a totemic importance. Strange argues for five shortcoming of regime theory: that it is a passing fad, is imprecise, has a value bias, is too static and is too state-centred. As in ‘What is Economic Power, and Who has it?’ (1975) the underlying history of bargains, which condition regimes are emphasised as being crucial to any understanding of the IPE.

While this includes elements of the later four dimensions - the idea of the authority/market balance and the security structure - her arguments here are not fully developed, as is evident from the rather heated discussion between her and the discussants (Robert Z.

Any analysis should start by recognising the key historical bargains that were made within the economic structure. But the editors are not sure of the present possibility of an all embracing theory of international political economy. They conclude: there is a lessening possibility of dividing off the national from the international; any study of international relations (political or economic) must take account of values to avoid sterility in the analysis of outcomes; a structural analysis is not necessarily incompatible with realism; and IPE can only be meaningful where it builds on international economic history.

She wants work on the international monetary system to go beyond a mere mechanical explanation and to move towards a more political analysis (which would also include an assessment of the impact of technology on global finance).

Suggesting that states can choose to grow by direction (the socialist route) or via debt, she argues that recently the combination of the welfare state and more complex credit system has allowed many states to reduce the debt risk they explicitly face and therefore expand through the extensive use of credit. In the second part of the chapter she places the recent debt crises into the context of international credit since the mid-nineteenth century, and concludes that despite the supposed risks of default, historically the best growth rates have been in those countries extended the greatest credit (in Latin America). Furthermore, provided it is well managed there is nothing to indicate that a larger pool of credit (and therefore indebtedness) is any more problematic than a smaller pool, explicitly modifying her conclusion regarding the links between risky loans and political conflict in \u0026lsquo;Debts, Defaulters and Development\u0026rsquo;.\nKeywords: Money and Finance\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:171,href:"/archive/the_management_of_surplus_capacity_or_how_does_theory_stand_up_to_protectionism_1970s_style/",title:"The Mamagement of Surplus Capacity: Or How Does Theory Stand up to Protectionism 1970s style?",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;The Mamagement of Surplus Capacity: Or How Does Theory Stand up to Protectionism 1970s style?\u0026rdquo; International Organisation 36, no. 2 (1979): 303-335.\nIn this article, which is a clear precursor to The Politics of International Surplus Capacity (with Roger Tooze, 1981), Strange discusses the management of surplus capacity in three sectors of the international economy - steel, textiles and shipbuilding, and the recourse to protectionism. She then goes on to discuss the problems this implies for mainstream theories of international economics. She argues that Liberalism, theories of development, and organisational or functionalist theories do not offer satisfactory explanations for the resurgence of tariff barriers. This is partly because none of these theories deal with economic power satisfactorily, though Strange offers little in the way of a corrective. She concludes by again arguing that it is increasingly difficult to draw a line between international and domestic policy, and thus theories that only deal with one or other side of this duality will by implication fail in their analysis.

Having suggested that the central country in the monetary system (the U.S.) could either try to co-ordinate activities, or by its very dominance alleviate the crisis by putting its own house in order, she suggests the best (though least likely) solution would be some form of global central bank.

On one side the authors suggest that developing countries, where possible may need to develop national carriers to allow them to influence the management of shipping as well offering an secure avenue for their own trade.

Furthermore, the impact of international business is becoming a transnational process across states rather than an international process between them.

Noting both the lack of reserves held by the British government and Britain’s extra-European financial commitments, Strange argues that de Gaulle may be correct in thinking it is impossible for Britain to act ‘like good Europeans’. Thus, one proposed solution to the sterling problem, monetary association with Europe, would have little support on the Continent.

She suggests an ‘import bounty’ system, to diffuse opposition, paid for through a tax on developed states domestic and exporting manufacturers. While encouraging industry in developing states, instead of commodity exports, this would reduce the ‘loading of the dice’ identified by G77. Even if not achievable multilaterally, bilateral implementation would help revive help to the developing world and help developed state’s industry to revive through competition.

However, she also suggests that the immediate aftermath appears to have been a retreat into détente, rather than renewed confrontation.

This distorted or uneven growth in trade had not only had an unsettling effect of world trade, but has also required developing states to take out loans to support their development. Strange suggests that in the long term such an approach is not sustainable, especially if the benefits of international trade are unevenly enjoyed. This leads Strange to suggest four international economic policies to alleviate these problems: the stabilisation of commodity prices to reduce the risks of underdeveloped states' trade; the opening of developed markets (the reduction of tariffs) to the products of the developing states; the use of developed states agricultural surpluses to aid industrial development in poorer states; and international exchange rate co-ordination to stabilise the terms of trade.

London: Stevens, 1951.\nAgain discussing the linkage between politics and economics, Strange points out that economic integration could not be achieved without political control from above, that it is not possible for economic integration to move forward without the political will for it to happen. However the clear aim of the Schumann Plan was to redress the balance of economic power in Western Europe in favour of France and at the expense of Germany, rather than necessarily provide for increased integration.\nKeywords: Europe; Hegemony; Political Economy; United States; International Relations; European Integration\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:213,href:"/archive/point_four_helping_develop_half_a_world/",title:"Point Four.

While the Arabs were negotiating in a state that was essentially antipathetic to their struggle, their opposite numbers were surrounded by sympathisers and supporters both within and outside the organisation.

Keeton, Georg Schwarzenberger, editors. 264-288. London: Stevens, 1950.\nStrange discusses Truman\u0026rsquo;s fourth declared guiding rule of American foreign policy for the years 1949-1953, that \u0026lsquo;Our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts to produce more clothing, more materials for housing and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens\u0026rsquo;, stressing the technical and international nature of future assistance. She notes that American \u0026lsquo;internationalism\u0026rsquo; could be broken under the stresses of changing political and strategic circumstances. While the US needs to remain embedded within the international economy, the costs of technical co-operation are largely borne by the targeted Third World countries themselves. Strange points to the linkage between economics and politics, as a way of highlighting questions concerning the degree of freedom to use funds as recipients of US controlled aid and loans wish.\nKeywords: Hegemony; United States; US Foreign Policy; International Relations\nText access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:215,href:"/archive/palestine_and_the_un/",title:"Palestine and the UN",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. \u0026ldquo;Palestine and the UN.\u0026rdquo; In Year Book of World Affairs 1949, George W.

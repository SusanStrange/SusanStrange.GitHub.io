What is the nature of the powers of corporations in a globalized economy? Has there been a shift of power from states to corporations? From states to markets? And if yes, how and why? These are the sort of questions that were at heart of Susan Strange&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

This is an edited version of the text published as &amp;lsquo;What Theory? The Theory in Mad Money&amp;rsquo; (1998) with the addition of a new introduction which briefly lays out many of the arguments which Strange made her own over her long and distinguished career.</description>

      <title>The Westfailure System</title>

      <description>Susan Strange. &amp;ldquo;The Westfailure System.&amp;rdquo; Review of International Studies 25, no. 3 (1999): 345-354.
In this posthumously published essay, Strange briefly outlines the parallel histories of the territorial system of states and the economic system of markets and suggests that until the last quarter of the twentieth century each benefited the other. However, as she often argued in the 1990s, the political system is now failing in three areas: the states system is increasingly unable to manage instability in the global financial system; the sovereign system is unable to deal effectively with globalised environmental problems; and lastly the political system&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the global market is producing widening socio-economic inequality across the global system.</description>

      <title>Globaloney? (Review Essay)</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/globaloney/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;Globaloney? (Review Essay).&amp;rdquo; Review of International Political Economy 5, no. 4 (1998): 704-711.
In this review of the influential Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson Globalisation in Question (Oxford: Polity Press, 1996) alongside two other books arguing a similar position, Strange makes a major intervention in the debate over the &amp;lsquo;myth&amp;rsquo; of globalisation. Arguing that the authors (like others) miss the deterritorialisation of commercial power in the global system, Strange allows that there needs to be a corrective to the extreme globalisation thesis of complete transformation, but that a failure to examine what is really happening in the global political economy, while relying on aggregated and out-of-date statistics has led too many political economists to fail to recognise the very real changes in the balance of power between multinational corporations and states.</description>

      <title>Why do International Organisations Never Die?</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Why do International Organisations Never Die?.&amp;rdquo; In Autonomous Policy Making by International Organisations, Bob Reinalda, Bertjan Verbeek, editors. 213-220. London: Routledge, 1998.
In this concluding chapter of a collection of articles drawn from a series of workshops organised under the auspices of the ECPR, Strange reflects on the legacy of The Anatomy of Influence (see &amp;lsquo;‘IMF: Monetary Managers’ [1974]) and suggests that a focus on international organisation remains a largely European enterprise due to the continuing dominance of liberal institutionalism and (neo)Realism.</description>

      <title>Europe&#39;s Future in the Global Political Economy</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/europes_future_in_the_global_political_economy/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Europe&amp;rsquo;s Future in the Global Political Economy.&amp;rdquo; In Reflections on the Identity of Europe: Global Transatlantic Perspectives, Thomas Row, editor. Bologna: The John Hopkins University Bologna Center, 1996.
Strange argues in this reflection on the future of Europe that too little analytical attention has been paid to the corporate sector and its role in three important structural shifts in the global political economy: new and faster technological changes that have speeded up the competitive cycle (and reduced the time for investors to recover their outlay on innovation); moves in finance towards a much more globalised financial sector with a reduction in the role of national (or in this case European Union) policy interventions; and a shift in the location of production, facilitated by the other two changes.</description>

      <title>The Defective State</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_defective_state/</link>

      <description>SStrange, Susan &amp;ldquo;The Defective State.&amp;rdquo; Daedelus 124, no. 2 (1995): 55-74.
Strange argues that while states remain superficially important as major actors within the global system, the underlying power relations have hollowed out their authority. This authority has in some cases flowed &amp;lsquo;upwards&amp;rsquo; to international institutions, and in other cases flowed down to markets (and also more localised organisations). These movements have led to an asymmetry of structural authority in the global system.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Global Government and Global Opposition.&amp;rdquo; In Politics in an Interdependent World, Geraint Parry, editor. 20-33. Aldershot: Edward Elgar Publishers, 1994.
After recognising the relevance of discussions of a &amp;lsquo;new medievalism&amp;rsquo; in the global political economy Strange suggests that the best way of addressing the nature and use of power is her structural model. She suggests that the deterriotrialisation of power and the increasing importance of &amp;lsquo;diplomacy&amp;rsquo; between firms as laid out in Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M.</description>

      <title>The Transformation of the World Economy</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Transformation of the World Economy.&amp;rdquo; In Mapping the Unknown: Towards a New World Order (Yearbook of the Swedish Institute for International Affairs 1992-1993), Lidija Babic, Bo Huldt, editors. 43-49. London: Hurst and Co., 1993.
In this short article Strange reviews many of the same arguments that have been featured above. However, here she argues that the transformation of the world economy is not so much the product of state/firm interactions, rather it is firms that are playing (and will continue to play) the more important role in structural change.</description>

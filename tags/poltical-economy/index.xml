      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Reactions to Brandt. Popular Acclaim and Academic Attack,&amp;rdquo; International Studies Quarterly 25, no. 2 (1981): 328-342.
Strange’s ‘review of the reviews’ draws two distinctions between reactions to the Brandt Report - American and European, popular and academic. Her discussion briefly outlines the ‘global Keynsianism’ aspects of the report before noting the criticisms that were levelled at it. After noting that in the academy many of the analyses of the problems and ‘pie in the sky’ solutions were nothing new, her final lament is that the report continues to accept the curative value of research and knowledge, set aside from the political process.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan, and Roger Tooze, eds., The International Politics of Surplus Capacity: Competition for Market Shares in the World. London: Allen and Unwin, 1981.
This is a collection of 17 essays resulting from a conference held by the International Political Economy Group of the BISA, together with an editorial overview of theoretical approaches to IPE and a conclusion concerning the agreements and differences among the contributors. Writing with Tooze, Strange notes that it is not intended to dispense with the ‘insights’ of the realists, but it is necessary to widen their approach considerably.</description>

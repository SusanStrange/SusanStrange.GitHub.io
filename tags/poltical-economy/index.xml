      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Reactions to Brandt. Popular Acclaim and Academic Attack,&amp;rdquo; International Studies Quarterly 25, no. 2 (1981): 328-342.
Strange’s ‘review of the reviews’ draws two distinctions between reactions to the Brandt Report - American and European, popular and academic. Her discussion briefly outlines the ‘global Keynsianism’ aspects of the report before noting the criticisms that were levelled at it. After noting that in the academy many of the analyses of the problems and ‘pie in the sky’ solutions were nothing new, her final lament is that the report continues to accept the curative value of research and knowledge, set aside from the political process.</description>

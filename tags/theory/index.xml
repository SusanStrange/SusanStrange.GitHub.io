Blayne Haggart, Kathryn Henne, Natasha Tusikov, editors. 25-52. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019. According to many observers, economic globalization and the liberalization of telecoms/internet policy have remade the world in the image of the United States. The dominant roles of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have also led to charges of US internet imperialism.</description>

      <title>International Political Economy: The Story so Far and the Way Ahead</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/international_political_economy_the_story_so_far_and_the_way_ahead/</link>

      <description>In An International Political Economy (International Political Economy Yearbook No.1), edited by W. Ladd Hollist and F. LaMond Tullis, 13-25.Boulder:Westview Press, 1985.
After noting again the essential role of economic historians in the study and understanding of the international political economy, Strange builds on an appreciation of the value of development economists, a plea for the re-inclusion of values into the study of IPE. This in the main is because they are already tacitly included, but there is little engagement with the economist’s prioritising of efficiency or the International Relations scholar’s of peace.</description>

      <title>The poverty of multilateral economic diplomacy</title>

      <description>In Diplomacy at the United Nations, edited by Geoff Berridge and Anthony Jennings, 109-129. London: Macmillan Press, 1985.
After reviewing the four values authority might pursue - wealth, security, justice and freedom (an argument developed at more length in States and Markets (1988), she uses these value choices to interrogate the three main paradigms used to think about the international political economy, liberalism, structuralism and nationalism. She then examines UN economic multilateralism utilising an eclectic combination of all three perspectives and concludes that as each approach continues to look to international organisation to sustain the values it emphasises, despite its failings economic multilateralism is likely to continue to be regarded as a worthwhile enterprise.</description>

      <title>Structures, Values and Risk in the Study of the International Political Economy</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/structures_values_and_risk/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Structures, Values and Risk in the Study of the International Political Economy,&amp;rdquo; In Perspectives on Political Economy, edited by R.J. Barry Jones, 209-230. London: Francis Printer Journals, 1983.
In this article Strange argues for the centrality of questions surrounding the nature of risk and how it is mitigated, managed and transferred in the international economy. In addition she suggests five structures of power in IPE, noting that she is adding to the Marxist concept of a production structure.</description>

      <title>Cave! Hic Dragones: A Critique of Regime Analysis</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/cave_hic_dragones_a_critique_of_regime_analysis/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Cave! Hic Dragones: A Critique of Regime Analysis,&amp;rdquo; International Organisation 36 no. 2, (1982): 337-354.
Strange’s classic critique of regime theory, often used as a touchstone for those regime-theorists wanting to make the point they recognise that there have been criticisms of their approach. As such it has at least a totemic importance. Strange argues for five shortcoming of regime theory: that it is a passing fad, is imprecise, has a value bias, is too static and is too state-centred.</description>

      <title>Looking Back - But Mostly Forward</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Looking Back - But Mostly Forward,&amp;rdquo; Millennium Journal of International Relations 11, no. 1 (1982):38-49.
In this survey article, Strange looks back across the first ten years of Millennium to examine the development of International Relations, although as she makes plain she prefers the term International Studies. Having seen the field expand from a focus on the foreign polices of various states, she maps the increasing interest in the international system itself.</description>

      <title>The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_politics_of_economics_a_sectoral_analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:33:02 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_politics_of_economics_a_sectoral_analysis/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis,&amp;rdquo; In Economic Issues and the Atlantic Community, edited by Wolfram F. Hanrieder, 15-26. New York: Praeger, 1982.
Strange here proposes a structural approach that is implied by her argument that an analysis of the global political economy must be concerned with its ‘environment’. However, while suggesting three of her four later structures - here, security, monetary and production structures - she also includes a number of other structures - transport, trade, communication - that would later become in her schema, secondary structures.</description>

      <description>Susan Strange, &amp;ldquo;Point Four. Helping Develop Half a World,&amp;rdquo; Peacefinder Series: 7, London: United Nations Association, (1950).
Strange comments on the UN deliberations concerning the future of Palestine and highlights the central factor that gave the Zionists an in-built advantage at the assembly. While the Arabs were negotiating in a state that was essentially antipathetic to their struggle, their opposite numbers were surrounded by sympathisers and supporters both within and outside the organisation.</description>

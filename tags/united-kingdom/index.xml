      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;Finance and Capitalism: The City&amp;rsquo;s Imperial Role Yesterday and Today.&amp;rdquo; Review of International Studies 20, no. 4 (1994): 407-410.
In this short review of P.J. Cain and A.G. Hopkins British Imperialism (2 vols) (London: Longman 1993), Strange again emphasises the structural characteristics of US power in the global system and suggest that Britain&amp;rsquo;s structural power was more long lasting than is sometimes presumed, with clear implications for the continuing power of the US in the global economy.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. Sterling and British Policy: A Political Study of an International Currency in Decline. London: Oxford University Press, 1971.
Strange proposes a four element theoretical framework for international currencies in the international political economy: Neutral currencies; Top currencies; Master Currencies; and Negotiated currencies, where each category exhibits certain economic and political characteristics. A currency may display more than one set of characteristics but will belong predominantly to one category. She then goes on to discuss the development of the international political economy in light of the decline of sterling and the rise of the dollar.</description>

      <title>Sterling and British Policy: A Political View</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Sterling and British Policy: A Political View.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 47, no. 2 (1971): 302-315.
Strange sets the decline of sterling and the rise of the dollar in the context of international politics. She stresses the need to integrate economic studies with those of international relations. Both state behaviour and the behaviour of international society, hitherto interpreted in terms of power and politics should now be extended to take in the monetary factor especially in the light of economic interdependence - the monetary factor is bound to become increasingly important in understanding state behaviour.</description>

      <title>The Sterling Problem and the Six</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. The Sterling Problem and the Six. London:Chatham House/PEP, 1967.
In this small pamphlet Strange analyses the twin roles of sterling in the international economy - that of reserve currency and of vehicle currency (in which transactions are carried out), in a precursor to her typology of currencies in Sterling and British Policy (1971). She argues that while the City has benefited from the expansion of the ‘Euro-currency’ markets, in its ‘middleman’ role, this has led to a number of problems for sterling both in the wider context of the international economy and, more specifically, the context of the emerging European Community.</description>

      <title>British Foreign Policy</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;British Foreign Policy.&amp;rdquo; In Year Book of World Affairs 1955, George W. Keeton, Georg Schwarzenberger, editors. 35-53. London: Stevens, 1955.
Strange argues that a state whose power is waning is more liable to make fatal mistakes. British economic survival could only be made possible by conditions of expanding world trade, rising standards of living in export markets and a minimum of economic nationalism. Britain&amp;rsquo;s future thus largely depends on the US, as she is no longer as essential as a market and supplier of capital as she once was to the members of the Commonwealth.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;An International Political Economy Perspective.&amp;rdquo; In Governments, Globalization, and International Business, John H. Dunning, editor. 132-145. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.
In this chapter Strange lays out her idea of what International Political Economy is, including a wide-ranging view of politics (not just the activities of politicians and governments) and a focus on structural power. This then leads her to discuss the problems that globalisation presents for governments, business and people.</description>

      <title>Globalisation and Capitalist Diversity: Experiences on the Asian Mainland</title>

      <description>Susan Strange, editor. Globalisation and Capitalist Diversity: Experiences on the Asian Mainland. Florence: European University Institute/Robert Schulman Centre, 1997.
This volume collects together papers presented at a conference organised by Strange at the EUI on 2-4th May 1996. Strange herself only contributed an introduction outlining the papers in the volume and discussing the organisational background to the conference. Strange argues that comparative politics scholars and international business academics need to &amp;lsquo;build bridges&amp;rsquo; between the two disciplines to better understand the interaction between states and firms.</description>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/political_economy_and_international_relations/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Political Economy and International Relations.&amp;rdquo; In International Relations Theory Today, Ken Booth, Steve Smith, editors. 154-174. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995.
Noting that it is over twenty years since she and others argued for the end of the false division between politics and economics, Strange argues that the development of modern IPE has been in reaction to events within the global system. She suggests that there is still a division between an American IPE based conception of the Politics of International Economic Relations, and a non-American approach that bears some similarity to her own framework as laid out in States and Markets (1988) and elsewhere.</description>

      <title>International Political Economy: Reuniting Three Fields of Intellectual Endeavour</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/international_political_economy_reuniting_three_fields_of_intellectual_endeavour/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:33:09 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/international_political_economy_reuniting_three_fields_of_intellectual_endeavour/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;International Political Economy: Reuniting Three Fields of Intellectual Endeavour.&amp;rdquo; Liberal Education 75, no. 3 (1989): 20-24.
Strange uses the work she was co-ordinating with John Stopford, later published as Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M. Stopford, 1991) to launch a critique of the separation of International Relations, International Economics and the research carried out in business schools. She argues that her approach, foregrounding structural power, requires analysis from all three directions and therefore there needs to be much better contact and co-operation between the three fields.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Transnational Empire</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/towards_a_theory_of_transnational_empire/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/towards_a_theory_of_transnational_empire/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Towards a Theory of Transnational Empire.&amp;rdquo; In Global Changes and Theoretical Challenges: Approaches to World Politics for the 1990s, Ernst-Otto Czempiel, James N. Roseneau, editors. 161-176. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1989.
In this article Strange offers only her second explicit excursion into the epistemology of international theories, the first being a similar section in States and Markets (1988). She argues that theories must be more than description, taxonomy, importation of models from other disciplines or quantitative and that theories must explain some aspect of the international system not obvious to &amp;lsquo;commonsense&amp;rsquo;.</description>

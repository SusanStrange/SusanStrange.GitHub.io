      <title>The Retreat of the State. State Diffusion of Power in the World Economy</title>

      <description>In what might effectively be regarded as the third part of a trilogy, together with (1988e) and (Strange and Stopford 1991), Strange examines states’ transition towards the sidelines of global political economic relations. Though in the past authority might have been state based, now she argues it is more often based on non-state abilities to bring about (or structure) outcomes. This has to some extent been obscured by the increasing intervention by states in the lives of their citizens, giving an impression of the retention of power.</description>

      <title>European Business in Japan. A Policy Cross-roads?</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/european_business_in_japan/</link>

      <description>Contrasting European and American proposals for the perceived difficulty of setting up foreign owned subsidiaries in Japan, Strange argues that this is a central issue for any nascent European foreign policy initiative. She argues that it may now be beyond any nationally elected government (even in the US.) to re-impose its hegemonic intent on other states. But some co-ordinated pressure from Japanese and European policy bodies may support the reintroduction into global politics of a more interdependent (and less free-market) approach to commercial and financial diplomacy.</description>

      <description>In this short review of P.J. Cain and A.G. Hopkins British Imperialism (2 vols) (London: Longman 1993), Strange again emphasises the structural characteristics of US power in the global system and suggest that Britain’s structural power was more long lasting than is sometimes presumed, with clear implications for the continuing power of the US in the global economy.

      <title>Who Governs? Networks of Power in World Society</title>

      <description>Starting from Strange’s response to Waltz’s (in)famous London School of Economic lecture (see Millennium 22/2 - Summer 1993) in this article she first argues for a wider reading of politics – not just what states do. She then briefly summarises her arguments regarding structural power before discussing the roles states have historically played as producers of security, credit, market relations and environment. The power over finance and environment has moved to centre stage, but states have been losing relative power over these areas.</description>

      <description>Strange discusses the difference between American structural power and Japanese relational power in the financial structure. In addition she discusses the impact of communications technology changes on the operation of international financial markets, which represents an illuminating case study of how two structures interact with each other to bring about changes in the international political economy, in this case the financial and knowledge structures. In addition Strange notes that at least part of American structural power is derived from the privileged position of the ‘American-English’ language in the knowledge structure.</description>

      <description>In this review of Robert Gilpin’s Political Economy of International Relations, Strange again argues against ‘Hegemonic Stability Theory’, see (1987), but has started to develop a theory of transnational empire to explain the structural power of the United States. Part of this argument is the increasing non-territoriality of structural power, which is developed in a number of works below.

      <title>The Future of the American Empire</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_future_of_the_american_empire/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_future_of_the_american_empire/</guid>
      <description>Strange argues that increasingly power in the international political economy is not territorially defined, and what has emerged is an empire that is not territorially based, and secondly is controlled by information-rich US corporations. However while she call this the ‘American Empire’ her argument is (self-avowedly) close to an international Gramscian ‘historical bloc’ analysis. Thus the controlling bureaucracy of this empire while based on American values and culture is not necessarily staffed by Americans.</description>

      <title>The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_persistent_myth_of_lost_hegemony/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_persistent_myth_of_lost_hegemony/</guid>
      <description>Strange’s classic attack of the ‘declinist school’ in international relations. Once she has discussed the more ‘sociological’ reasons for American academics holding this view (of which the most powerful/cynical is that it is essentially a convenient denial of responsibility by Americans for their effect on the international system), Strange goes on to elaborate the four structures of power in IPE. This exposition closely parallels (though in a brief form) the arguments that appear in (1988e).</description>

      <title>Casino Capitalism</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/casino_capitalism/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/casino_capitalism/</guid>
      <description>Strange argues that uncertainty and risk in the financial sector/structure have provoked major economic disturbances in the last twenty or so years. This work represents a detailed sectoral history and analysis which argues against many of the proposed solutions to the international economic crisis she identifies. Strange argues that the United States must once again take up the leadership role (which it enjoys by virtue of economic preponderance) and more radically suggests that in the future financial regulation of credit creating agencies should not be a territorially based jurisdiction, but based on the currencies themselves wherever the credit transactions take place.</description>

      <title>The Credit Crisis: A European View</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_credit_crisis/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/the_credit_crisis/</guid>
      <description>Strange here uses the term crisis, but notes that the implication that some sort of solution is imminent is less than certain. She suggests that the world economic crisis has three interrelated aspects: unemployment, ‘flagging trade’, and unstable money. As in (1979a) she shows some scepticism to the arguments that demonise protectionism, and suggests this is an essentially ideological position that would not repay global implementation. After briefly rehearsing the global financial history of the previous decade, Strange suggests that financial regulation which in the last analysis is dependent on certain sovereign states, can never be disinterested.</description>

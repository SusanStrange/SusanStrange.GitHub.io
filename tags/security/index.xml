There is a widespread feeling that globalization represents a major system change that has or should have brought world society to the forefront of international relations theory. Nonetheless, world society remains an amorphous and undertheorized concept, and its potential role in shaping the structure of the international society of states has scarcely been raised.</description>

      <title>Power and Counter-Power: Knowledge Structure and the Limits of Control.</title>

In this article, we explore Susan Strange&amp;rsquo;s multidimensional and non-reductive international political economy (IPE) approach to structural power. Strange&amp;rsquo;s key weakness is the failure to account for her knowledge structure&amp;rsquo;s regulative form relative to her security, production and financial structures. We seek to develop Strange&amp;rsquo;s account through the addition of Manuel Castells&#39; account of digital network structures.</description>

      <description>Pasch, Korey. &amp;ldquo;Developing Disaster: Power, Structural Violence, Insurance-Linked Securities, and the International Political Economy of the Disaster Politics Nexus.&amp;rdquo; Journal of Natural Resources 8 nos. 1&amp;amp;2 (2018): 131-153.
This article presents an alternative framing of disasters as a form of structural violence resulting from the unequal distribution of structural power between various groups, organizations, institutions, and states in the contemporary global political economy. The article utilizes a theoretical framework that combines Johan Galtung’s typology of violence and Susan Strange’s conceptualization of structural power to open up new space for analysis in the disaster politics nexus.</description>

      <title>Caught up in the Madness? State Power and Transnational Organized Crime in the Work of Susan Strange</title>

When Susan Strange and I looked into the relationships between firms and States during the late 1980s, we were primarily concerned to signal that the rivalry among States for control over the means of wealth creation had grown to the point where it had overtaken such traditional concerns as control over territory, to become the predominant driver of diplomacy.</description>

      <title>The Persistence of Problems in EC-US Relations: Conflicts of Perception?</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Persistence of Problems in EC-US Relations: Conflicts of Perception?.&amp;rdquo; In The External Relations of the European Community, in Particular EC-US Relations, Jürgen Schwarze, editor. 109-118. Baden-Baden: Nomos Verlasgesellschaft, 1989.
Strange suggests that the two primary activities of any political organisation are the furtherance of security and the control of money, and it is these issues that remain at the centre of the problem of US-Europe relations. Here Strange again challenges the assumption of a loss of American hegemony (and therefore power) in the global system.</description>

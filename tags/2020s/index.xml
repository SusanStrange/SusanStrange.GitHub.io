      <description>Haggart, Blayne, Natasha Tusikov. *The New Knowledge: Information, Data, and the Remaking of Global Power.&amp;quot; Lantham, MD: Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, 2023. Open Access.
From the global geopolitical arena to the smart city, control over knowledge—particularly over data and intellectual property—has become a key battleground for the exercise of economic and political power. For companies and governments alike, control over knowledge—what scholar Susan Strange calls the knowledge structure—has become a goal unto itself.</description>

      <description>Dyer, Nat. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Susan Strange saw the financial crisis coming, Your Majesty&amp;rsquo;: The Case for the LSE’s Great Global Political Economist.&amp;rdquo; Real-World Economic Review 98 (2021): 92-111.
This paper makes three arguments. First, that Susan Strange (1923-1998), who founded the field of international political economy in the UK, is one of the principal thinkers who foresaw multiple aspects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. She deserves credit for her prescience but has been overlooked.</description>

      <description>Hutchings, Kimberly, Patricia Owens. &amp;ldquo;Women Thinkers and the Canon of International Thought: Recovery, Rejection, and Reconstitution.&amp;rdquo; American Political Science Review 115, no. 2 (2021): 347–59.
Canons of intellectual &amp;lsquo;greats&amp;rsquo; anchor the history and scope of academic disciplines. Within international relations (IR), such a canon emerged in the mid-twentieth century and is almost entirely male. Why are women thinkers absent from IR’s canon? We show that it is not due to a lack of international thought, or that this thought fell outside established IR theories.</description>

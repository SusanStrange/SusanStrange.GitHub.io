      <description>Dyer, Nat. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Susan Strange saw the financial crisis coming, Your Majesty&amp;rsquo;: The Case for the LSE’s Great Global Political Economist.&amp;rdquo; Real-World Economic Review 98 (2021).
This paper makes three arguments. First, that Susan Strange (1923-1998), who founded the field of international political economy in the UK, is one of the principal thinkers who foresaw multiple aspects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. She deserves credit for her prescience but has been overlooked.</description>

      <title>Globalization and the Rise of Integrated World Society: Deterritorialization, Structural-Power, and the Endogenization of International Society.</title>

There is a widespread feeling that globalization represents a major system change that has or should have brought world society to the forefront of international relations theory. Nonetheless, world society remains an amorphous and undertheorized concept, and its potential role in shaping the structure of the international society of states has scarcely been raised.</description>

      <description>David, Matthew, Cynthia Meersohn Schmidt &amp;ldquo;Power and Counter-Power: Knowledge Structure and the Limits of Control.&amp;rdquo; Sociological Research Online 24, no. 1 (2019): 21-37.
In this article, we explore Susan Strange&amp;rsquo;s multidimensional and non-reductive international political economy (IPE) approach to structural power. Strange&amp;rsquo;s key weakness is the failure to account for her knowledge structure&amp;rsquo;s regulative form relative to her security, production and financial structures. We seek to develop Strange&amp;rsquo;s account through the addition of Manuel Castells&#39; account of digital network structures.</description>

      <description>Norrlof, Carla. &amp;ldquo;Dollar Hegemony: A Power Analysis.&amp;rdquo; Review of International Political Economy 21, no. 5 (2014): 1042-1070.
The dollar has been the world&amp;rsquo;s first currency since the end of World War II, possibly since the inter-war period, and is the leading currency today. A growing chorus of observers believes this dollar-centered order is coming to an end. While much commentary revolves around changes in the distribution of power, measures are only loosely related to the material basis for currency dominance.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. Mad Money. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998.
In this sequel to Casino Capitalism (1986) Strange returns to a concentration on the financial structure. Her final book finds Strange once again emphasising the need to recognise the problems of instability in the global financial sector. Arguing that the system itself needed to be reformed, she once again refused to accept that the current upheavals were inevitable or unavoidable.

      <title>The New World of Debt</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;The New World of Debt.&amp;rdquo; New Left Review 230, July/August (1998): 91-114.
An extract from Mad Money (1998) in which Strange focuses on the problems of international indebtedness in the 1990s including the Mexican, Brazilian and Asian debt crises and a discussion of central and Eastern European issues. She suggests that the key problem has not been the indebtedness of poor states itself, but the sorts of credit historically extended and the timidity of the solutions to the problems that have arisen.</description>

      <title>What Theory? The Theory in Mad Money (CSGR Working Paper No. 18/98)</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/what_theory_the_theory_in_mad_money/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. What Theory? The Theory in Mad Money (CSGR Working Paper No. 18/98). Coventry: University of Warwick/Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation, 1998.
In this, her final piece of writing, Strange reprise arguments from &amp;lsquo;Rival States, Rival Firms&amp;rsquo; (with John M. Stopford, 1991) and The Retreat of the State (1996) to argue that the disciplines of International Relations and International Economics fail to understand contemporary globalisation. Where IR scholars have missed the structural shifts in the global system away from state-centric power with the emergence of new non-state authority, economists have missed the role of the state in promoting these changes, and misunderstand the working of global markets, discounting, or not even recognising the political relations between firms, what Strange refers to as the new diplomacy.</description>

      <title>Who are EU? Ambiguities in the Concept of Competitiveness</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/who_are_eu_ambiguities/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/who_are_eu_ambiguities/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;Who are EU? Ambiguities in the Concept of Competitiveness.&amp;rdquo; Journal of Common Market Studies 36, no. 1 (1998): 101-114.
Building on the argument of Robert Reich that the location of economic activity (in a state) was more important for its competitiveness than the ownership of companies (whose production was carried out abroad), Strange suggests that unless European policy recognises the importance of society based competitiveness rather than firm-based competitiveness, Europe&amp;rsquo;s economic problems cannot be overcome.</description>

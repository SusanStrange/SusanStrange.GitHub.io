There is a widespread feeling that globalization represents a major system change that has or should have brought world society to the forefront of international relations theory. Nonetheless, world society remains an amorphous and undertheorized concept, and its potential role in shaping the structure of the international society of states has scarcely been raised.</description>

      <title>Globaloney? (Review Essay)</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;Globaloney? (Review Essay).&amp;rdquo; Review of International Political Economy 5, no. 4 (1998): 704-711.
In this review of the influential Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson Globalisation in Question (Oxford: Polity Press, 1996) alongside two other books arguing a similar position, Strange makes a major intervention in the debate over the &amp;lsquo;myth&amp;rsquo; of globalisation. Arguing that the authors (like others) miss the deterritorialisation of commercial power in the global system, Strange allows that there needs to be a corrective to the extreme globalisation thesis of complete transformation, but that a failure to examine what is really happening in the global political economy, while relying on aggregated and out-of-date statistics has led too many political economists to fail to recognise the very real changes in the balance of power between multinational corporations and states.</description>

      <title>An International Political Economy Perspective</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;An International Political Economy Perspective.&amp;rdquo; In Governments, Globalization, and International Business, edited by John H. Dunning, 132-145. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.
In this chapter Strange lays out her idea of what International Political Economy is, including a wide-ranging view of politics (not just the activities of politicians and governments) and a focus on structural power. This then leads her to discuss the problems that globalisation presents for governments, business and people.</description>

      <title>The Erosion of the State</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_erosion_of_the_state/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;The Erosion of the State.&amp;rdquo; Current History 96, no. 613 (1997): 365-369.
Strange briefly revisits the globalisation debate and suggests those who argue that as the state still exists, globalisation can be ignored are very mistaken. She then goes on to outline three dilemmas of globalisation: the economic, in that increasingly there is no political authority able to govern and control market relations; the environmental, while on one hand market actors are driven by the profit motive to use up environmental resources, countervailing power is largely absent; the political, there is a major democratic deficit in the governance structure of the global system.</description>

      <title>The Problem or the Solution? Capitalism and the State System</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_problem_or_the_solution_capitalism/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_problem_or_the_solution_capitalism/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Problem or the Solution? Capitalism and the State System.&amp;rdquo; In Innovation and Transformation in International Studies, edited by Stephen Gill, James H. Mittelman, 236-247. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.
Again Strange criticises International Relations for not focusing on the systemic problems, not least of all environmental and financial issues which a concern for inter-state relations misses. Thus International Political Economy is open to approaches from political geography, historical sociology and elsewhere that have not been fixated on the relations between states as the key causal factor in the global system.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Politics</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_limits_of_politics/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Limits of Politics.&amp;rdquo; Government and Opposition 30, no. 3 (1995): 291-311.
Originally delivered as a lecture at the LSE this article finds Strange explicitly engaging with the notion of globalisation. For Strange globalisation is: the development of products for explicitly global and transnational markets; the decline of barriers and distinctions between national economies; the emergence of at least partial labour mobility in addition to the more recognised capital mobility; and the speeding up of transport and communications.</description>

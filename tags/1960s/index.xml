      <description>Goodwin, Geoffry, and Susan Strange. &amp;ldquo;Research on International Organisation.&amp;rdquo; Social Science Research Council Review of Current Research 2. (1968).
Acting as a rapporteur for the SSRC Advisory Group on International Organisation (chaired by Goodwin), Strange maps out current and future research as well as examining its organisation and administration. Though published two year prior to Strange’s first call for the establishment of International Political Economy, in &amp;lsquo;International economics and international relations: a case of mutual neglect&amp;rsquo; (1970), this report on the discussion of research into international organisation and international relations reveals many themes (from the impact of structure and technology to the importance of international economics) she would develop in her own work.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Debts, Defaulters, and Development.&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 43, no. 3 (1967): 516-529.
Strange suggests that problems of national debt default have not been solved, merely suppressed by the expansion of credit provision. Developing states dependence on ‘supplier credit’, and frequent rescheduling of other debts will lead to eventual wide-spread default unless action is taken. She suggests that: principles governing international loans should be established; these ‘rules’ should be applied through aid-agencies and other international bodies; technical assistance to finance ministries should be available from multilateral institutions (the World Bank, possibly) to ensure states understand their fiscal position and their options.</description>

      <title>The Sterling Problem and the Six</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. The Sterling Problem and the Six. London:Chatham House/PEP, 1967.
In this small pamphlet Strange analyses the twin roles of sterling in the international economy - that of reserve currency and of vehicle currency (in which transactions are carried out), in a precursor to her typology of currencies in Sterling and British Policy (1971). She argues that while the City has benefited from the expansion of the ‘Euro-currency’ markets, in its ‘middleman’ role, this has led to a number of problems for sterling both in the wider context of the international economy and, more specifically, the context of the emerging European Community.</description>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Sterling Question.&amp;rdquo; In Britain and the Common Market edited by Anthony Moncrieff, 43-50. London, BBC, 1967.
In this text of a radio talk first broadcast on 19th February 1967, Strange summarises the arguments she made in The Sterling Problem and the Six (1967). Discussing the links between Britain and the European Community, she examines the international position of sterling in a time of monetary crisis. Noting both the lack of reserves held by the British government and Britain’s extra-European financial commitments, Strange argues that de Gaulle may be correct in thinking it is impossible for Britain to act ‘like good Europeans’.</description>

      <title>A New Look at Trade and Aid</title>

      <description>Susan Strange, &amp;ldquo;A New Look at Trade and Aid,&amp;rdquo; International Affairs 42 no. 1 (January, 1966): 61 - 73.
In the light of UNCTAD’s problems, declining optimism over foreign aid and the unfavourable terms of trade for developing states, Strange suggests that ‘Prebisch’s thesis’, allowing subsidised exporting by developing states, and the dropping of tariff barriers, while unpopular would be a useful way forward. She suggests an ‘import bounty’ system, to diffuse opposition, paid for through a tax on developed states domestic and exporting manufacturers.</description>

      <title>Review of: J.L Allen Soviet Economic Power</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.github.io/archive/review_of_jl_allen/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Review of: J.L Allen Soviet Economic Power.&amp;rdquo; Economica 28, no. 109. (1961): 98-99.
Strange challenges the implicit assertion by the author that the interpretation of Soviet interest, or its choice of the means to an end, is static. She also doubts the ascription by the author of Finnish subservience to the Soviet Union as being solely one of economic dependence rather than strategic vulnerability. As one would expect Strange dismisses mono-causality, as she continues to do in all her work.</description>

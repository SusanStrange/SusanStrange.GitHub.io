Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
Susan Strange’s framework for international political economic analysis emphasises the importance of the interrelationships between what she saw as four interlinked structures and sources of power in the global economy: security, production, finance, and knowledge.</description>

      <title>Power and Counter-Power: Knowledge Structure and the Limits of Control.</title>

      <description>David, Matthew, Cynthia Meersohn Schmidt &amp;ldquo;Power and Counter-Power: Knowledge Structure and the Limits of Control.&amp;rdquo; Sociological Research Online 24, no. 1 (2019): 21-37.
In this article, we explore Susan Strange&amp;rsquo;s multidimensional and non-reductive international political economy (IPE) approach to structural power. Strange&amp;rsquo;s key weakness is the failure to account for her knowledge structure&amp;rsquo;s regulative form relative to her security, production and financial structures. We seek to develop Strange&amp;rsquo;s account through the addition of Manuel Castells&#39; account of digital network structures.</description>

Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT)—internet-connected software embedded within physical products—has the potential to shift fundamentally traditional conceptions of ownership and the ways people can access, use, and control information.</description>

      <title>Who are EU? Ambiguities in the Concept of Competitiveness</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/who_are_eu_ambiguities/</link>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Who are EU? Ambiguities in the Concept of Competitiveness.&amp;rdquo; Journal of Common Market Studies 36, no. 1 (1998): 101-114.
Building on the argument of Robert Reich that the location of economic activity (in a state) was more important for its competitiveness than the ownership of companies (whose production was carried out abroad), Strange suggests that unless European policy recognises the importance of society based competitiveness rather than firm-based competitiveness, Europe&amp;rsquo;s economic problems cannot be overcome.</description>

      <title>The Problem or the Solution? Capitalism and the State System</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_problem_or_the_solution_capitalism/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_problem_or_the_solution_capitalism/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Problem or the Solution? Capitalism and the State System.&amp;rdquo; In Innovation and Transformation in International Studies, edited by Stephen Gill, James H. Mittelman, 236-247. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.
Again Strange criticises International Relations for not focusing on the systemic problems, not least of all environmental and financial issues which a concern for inter-state relations misses. Thus International Political Economy is open to approaches from political geography, historical sociology and elsewhere that have not been fixated on the relations between states as the key causal factor in the global system.</description>

      <title>Europe&#39;s Future in the Global Political Economy</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/europes_future_in_the_global_political_economy/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.org/archive/europes_future_in_the_global_political_economy/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Europe&amp;rsquo;s Future in the Global Political Economy.&amp;rdquo; In Reflections on the Identity of Europe: Global Transatlantic Perspectives, edited by Thomas Row. Bologna: The John Hopkins University Bologna Center, 1996.
Strange argues in this reflection on the future of Europe that too little analytical attention has been paid to the corporate sector and its role in three important structural shifts in the global political economy: new and faster technological changes that have speeded up the competitive cycle (and reduced the time for investors to recover their outlay on innovation); moves in finance towards a much more globalised financial sector with a reduction in the role of national (or in this case European Union) policy interventions; and a shift in the location of production, facilitated by the other two changes.</description>

      <title>The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_politics_of_economics_a_sectoral_analysis/</link>

      <guid>https://susanstrange.org/archive/the_politics_of_economics_a_sectoral_analysis/</guid>
      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;The Politics of Economics: A Sectoral Analysis.&amp;rdquo; In Economic Issues and the Atlantic Community, edited by Wolfram F. Hanrieder, 15-26. New York: Praeger, 1982.
Strange here proposes a structural approach that is implied by her argument that an analysis of the global political economy must be concerned with its ‘environment’. However, while suggesting three of her four later structures - here, security, monetary and production structures - she also includes a number of other structures - transport, trade, communication - that would later become in her schema, secondary structures.</description>

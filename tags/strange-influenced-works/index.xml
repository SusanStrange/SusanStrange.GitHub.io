      <description>Dyer, Nat. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Susan Strange saw the financial crisis coming, Your Majesty&amp;rsquo;: The Case for the LSE’s Great Global Political Economist.&amp;rdquo; Real-World Economic Review 98 (2021).
This paper makes three arguments. First, that Susan Strange (1923-1998), who founded the field of international political economy in the UK, is one of the principal thinkers who foresaw multiple aspects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. She deserves credit for her prescience but has been overlooked.</description>

Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
The U.S. and Canadian governments have long engaged in the surveillance of Indigenous peoples. Such practices have garnered public attention in light of recent events. This chapter reflects on two examples: protests against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline that crossed over the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the United States and the release of details regarding Project SITKA—a Canadian Royal Mounted Police “dataveillance” operation identifying and tracking Indigenous activists.</description>

There is a widespread feeling that globalization represents a major system change that has or should have brought world society to the forefront of international relations theory. Nonetheless, world society remains an amorphous and undertheorized concept, and its potential role in shaping the structure of the international society of states has scarcely been raised.</description>

      <description>David, Matthew, Cynthia Meersohn Schmidt &amp;ldquo;Power and Counter-Power: Knowledge Structure and the Limits of Control.&amp;rdquo; Sociological Research Online 24, no. 1 (2019): 21-37.
In this article, we explore Susan Strange&amp;rsquo;s multidimensional and non-reductive international political economy (IPE) approach to structural power. Strange&amp;rsquo;s key weakness is the failure to account for her knowledge structure&amp;rsquo;s regulative form relative to her security, production and financial structures. We seek to develop Strange&amp;rsquo;s account through the addition of Manuel Castells&#39; account of digital network structures.</description>

Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.
The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT)—internet-connected software embedded within physical products—has the potential to shift fundamentally traditional conceptions of ownership and the ways people can access, use, and control information.</description>

      <description>Tussie, Diana. &amp;ldquo;Shaping the World Beyond the &amp;lsquo;Core&amp;rsquo;: States and Markets In Susan Strange and the Future of Global Political Economy: Power, Control and Transformation, edited by Randall Germain, 73-86. London: Routledge, 2016.
This chapter argues that the global financial crisis of 2008 presented a unique opportunity to re-visit them and to re-evaluate Strange&amp;rsquo;s core argument about the enduring structural power of the US in global finance. It explains how this power was particularly apparent in two international developments that took place at the height of the crisis: the US international lender-of-last-resort role and the absence of a dollar crisis.</description>

      <title>The Westfailure System</title>

      <description>Susan Strange. &amp;ldquo;The Westfailure System.&amp;rdquo; Review of International Studies 25, no. 3 (1999): 345-354.
In this posthumously published essay, Strange briefly outlines the parallel histories of the territorial system of states and the economic system of markets and suggests that until the last quarter of the twentieth century each benefited the other. However, as she often argued in the 1990s, the political system is now failing in three areas: the states system is increasingly unable to manage instability in the global financial system; the sovereign system is unable to deal effectively with globalised environmental problems; and lastly the political system&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the global market is producing widening socio-economic inequality across the global system.</description>

      <title>Globaloney? (Review Essay)</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;Globaloney? (Review Essay).&amp;rdquo; Review of International Political Economy 5, no. 4 (1998): 704-711.
In this review of the influential Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson Globalisation in Question (Oxford: Polity Press, 1996) alongside two other books arguing a similar position, Strange makes a major intervention in the debate over the &amp;lsquo;myth&amp;rsquo; of globalisation. Arguing that the authors (like others) miss the deterritorialisation of commercial power in the global system, Strange allows that there needs to be a corrective to the extreme globalisation thesis of complete transformation, but that a failure to examine what is really happening in the global political economy, while relying on aggregated and out-of-date statistics has led too many political economists to fail to recognise the very real changes in the balance of power between multinational corporations and states.</description>

      <title>What Theory? The Theory in Mad Money (CSGR Working Paper No. 18/98)</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. What Theory? The Theory in Mad Money (CSGR Working Paper No. 18/98). Coventry: University of Warwick/Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation, 1998.
In this, her final piece of writing, Strange reprise arguments from &amp;lsquo;Rival States, Rival Firms&amp;rsquo; (with John M. Stopford, 1991) and The Retreat of the State (1996) to argue that the disciplines of International Relations and International Economics fail to understand contemporary globalisation. Where IR scholars have missed the structural shifts in the global system away from state-centric power with the emergence of new non-state authority, economists have missed the role of the state in promoting these changes, and misunderstand the working of global markets, discounting, or not even recognising the political relations between firms, what Strange refers to as the new diplomacy.</description>

      <title>Territory, State, Authority and Economy: A New Realist Ontology of Global Political Economy</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. &amp;ldquo;Territory, State, Authority and Economy: A New Realist Ontology of Global Political Economy.&amp;rdquo; In The New Realism: Perspectives on Multilateralism and World Order, edited by Robert W. Cox, 3-19. Basingstoke: Macmillan Press/United Nations University Press, 1997.
Strange argues that the global economy is in the midst of a transition; the close incidence of political authority, economic activity and geographical territory no longer holds. This has been caused by two main groups of factors: firstly changes derived from science and technology; and secondly structural changes within the global finance structure.</description>

      <title>The Erosion of the State</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan &amp;ldquo;The Erosion of the State.&amp;rdquo; Current History 96, no. 613 (1997): 365-369.
Strange briefly revisits the globalisation debate and suggests those who argue that as the state still exists, globalisation can be ignored are very mistaken. She then goes on to outline three dilemmas of globalisation: the economic, in that increasingly there is no political authority able to govern and control market relations; the environmental, while on one hand market actors are driven by the profit motive to use up environmental resources, countervailing power is largely absent; the political, there is a major democratic deficit in the governance structure of the global system.</description>

      <title>The Retreat of the State: State Diffusion of Power in the World Economy</title>

      <description>Strange, Susan. The Retreat of the State: State Diffusion of Power in the World Economy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.
In what might effectively be regarded as the third part of a trilogy, together with States and Markets (1988) and Rival States, Rival Firms (with John M. Stopford, 1991), Strange examines states&#39; transition towards the sidelines of global political economic relations. Though in the past authority might have been state based, now she argues it is more often based on non-state abilities to bring about (or structure) outcomes.</description>

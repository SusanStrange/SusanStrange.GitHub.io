The importance of the history of bargains for the international structure is identified, but not developed fully.

It is important to recognise that the US is its chief initiator of policy and influence, both directly through its constitutionally predominant position in the organisation and through its wider impact on the international environment in which the IMF operates.

She then concludes it is impossible to separate politics and economics, and that the indicators used to measure the level of European integration are unable to capture what is actually happening. Furthermore, the impact of international business is becoming a transnational process across states rather than an international process between them.

Developing states dependence on ‘supplier credit’, and frequent rescheduling of other debts will lead to eventual wide-spread default unless action is taken.

She argues that while the City has benefited from the expansion of the ‘Euro-currency’ markets, in its ‘middleman’ role, this has led to a number of problems for sterling both in the wider context of the international economy and, more specifically, the context of the emerging European Community. Sterling had become more vulnerable to changes elsewhere.

Noting both the lack of reserves held by the British government and Britain’s extra-European financial commitments, Strange argues that de Gaulle may be correct in thinking it is impossible for Britain to act ‘like good Europeans’. Thus, one proposed solution to the sterling problem, monetary association with Europe, would have little support on the Continent.

She suggests an ‘import bounty’ system, to diffuse opposition, paid for through a tax on developed states domestic and exporting manufacturers. While encouraging industry in developing states, instead of commodity exports, this would reduce the ‘loading of the dice’ identified by G77. Even if not achievable multilaterally, bilateral implementation would help revive help to the developing world and help developed state’s industry to revive through competition. Strange posits the structural problems of international trade, while suggesting the way forward through a combination of economics and politics.\nReprinted in: Roger Tooze and Christopher May, eds.

She also doubts the ascription by the author of Finnish subservience to the Soviet Union as being solely one of economic dependence rather than strategic vulnerability. As one would expect Strange dismisses mono-causality, as she continues to do in all her work.\nKeywords: Security, International-Relations\nText Access (External Link)\n"}),a.add({id:163,href:"/archive/the_soviet_trade_weapon/",title:"The Soviet Trade Weapon",description:"By Susan Strange",content:"Strange, Susan. The Soviet Trade Weapon. London: Phoenix House, 1959.\nThis pamphlet appeared in Background Books series. Taking a rather optimistic (though at that time widespread view) of the Soviet Bloc’s economic situation vis-à-vis the West, Strange concludes that Soviet economic (and political) influence is reliant on economic ‘trouble-spots’ and the aversion by many developing states to the West’s recent history of colonialism. This leads her to suggest that money then spent on military aid might be better spent helping developing countries deal with agricultural surplus capacity in the global a market, a theme she would return to in \u0026lsquo;The Management of Surplus Capacity\u0026rsquo; (1979). Furthermore, the economic cycle in the developed states could be better managed to reduce the destabilising effects on primary producers. Thus political activism by the West could do much to counter the ‘war without weapons’ represented by the contemporary Soviet trade and aid policy.\nKeywords: Porduction, Security, Trade, International-Relations\nText Access (external Link)\n"}),a.add({id:164,href:"/archive/point_four/",title:"Point Four.

While the Arabs were negotiating in a state that was essentially antipathetic to their struggle, their opposite numbers were surrounded by sympathisers and supporters both within and outside the organisation. She also discusses some of the limitations and problems with such negotiations within the forum of the UN, and alludes to structural impediments to the ‘fair’ settlement of differences.\nKeywords: Hegemony, United States, Economic Development, US-Foreign-Policy\nText Access (external link)\n"}),a.add({id:165,href:"/archive/",title:"Full Archive",description:"Collection of Susan Strange's Works and Influenced Works.",content:"This page contains the searchable bibliography of Susan Strange’s academic work, academic and journalistic work that draws on Susan Strange’s theories and ideas.
